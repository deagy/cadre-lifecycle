# Release Evidence Package

Use this skill to create or review an evidence bundle. Evidence supports a decision; it does not approve release, accept risk, deploy, or override missing gates.

## Evidence checklist

Collect and index:

- Exact source revision, changed paths, task ID, and scope exclusions.
- Build artifacts, checksums, SBOMs, provenance/signing status, and artifact retention location.
- Unit, integration, Gherkin, frontend, race, accessibility, security, dependency, container, secret-scan, Helm render/lint, OpenTofu validate, and policy-check results as applicable.
- Architecture, code, infrastructure, pipeline, security, compliance, support, and release reviews with dispositions.
- Human approvals or explicit missing-owner blockers for production, destructive, privileged, risk-acceptance, or persistent-environment actions.
- Unavailable validations with reason, host/tool constraints, and proposed prepared-runner follow-up.

## Guardrails

- Do not copy secrets, raw customer data, or overexposed logs into evidence.
- Prefer primary-source links and immutable identifiers.
- Preserve integrity hashes for generated evidence where practical.
- Call out stale, contradictory, unactionable, or self-attested evidence.
