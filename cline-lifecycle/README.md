# Cline Lifecycle Plugin (Agentic SDLC G1-G10 tools)

A third distinct plugin, alongside [`cline/`](../cline) (role-selection planning)
and [`cline-agents/`](../cline-agents) (role dispatch). This plugin,
`cline-lifecycle`, exposes G1-G10 Agentic SDLC lifecycle governance as 21
deterministic tool calls, wrapping the exact `bin/cadre sdlc <subcommand>`
invocations the `cadre-lifecycle-core`/`-github`/`-gitlab` plugins' skills
already document for Claude Code / Codex
(`plugins/lifecycle/skills/{lifecycle-onboarding,lifecycle-review,brief-pending-gates}/SKILL.md`,
all 8 of `plugins/lifecycle-gitlab/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and 8 of the 9
`plugins/lifecycle-github/skills/*/SKILL.md` (GitHub has one more skill than
GitLab — `publish-reviewer-nudge-github` has no GitLab equivalent, see
below), except `brief-pending-gates-{gitlab,github}` — see below). `sdlc_plan`
additionally wraps `agentic-sdlc plan`, a forge-agnostic kernel subcommand
referenced only in passing ("... or `cadre sdlc plan` first") across 13
forge-specific `SKILL.md` files rather than given a numbered step of its own
in any one of them — see its row in the table below.

Skills are a Claude Code / Codex mechanism with no Cline equivalent (see
[`../skills/run-agent-orchestration/references/runner-adapters.md`](../skills/run-agent-orchestration/references/runner-adapters.md)'s
"## Cline" section), so none of that governance was previously reachable from
Cline at all — this plugin closes that gap the same way `cline/` and
`cline-agents/` already close the equivalent gap for role selection/dispatch.

The 16 forge-specific tools close a further, narrower gap: `cadre-lifecycle-gitlab`
and `cadre-lifecycle-github` each bundle 8 forge-specific skills for Claude
Code / Codex, and every one of them but `brief-pending-gates-{gitlab,github}`
wraps a distinct forge-specific kernel subcommand — all of those are mirrored
here, one tool per subcommand:

- **GitLab (7 tools):** `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab`, `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab_mr`
  (`lifecycle-review-gitlab`); `sdlc_link_intent_from_gitlab_issue`,
  `sdlc_link_requirements_from_gitlab_issue` (`link-source-issue-gitlab`);
  `sdlc_list_gate_issues_gitlab`, `sdlc_create_gate_issues_gitlab`
  (`gitlab-gate-tracking`); `sdlc_request_gate_reviewers_gitlab`
  (`report-gate-reviewers-gitlab`).
- **GitHub (7 tools):** `sdlc_approve_from_github`, `sdlc_approve_from_github_pr`
  (`lifecycle-review-github`); `sdlc_list_github_gate_issues`,
  `sdlc_create_github_gate_issues` (`create-github-gate-issues`);
  `sdlc_request_gate_reviewers_github` (`report-gate-reviewers-github`);
  `sdlc_list_reviewer_nudge`, `sdlc_publish_reviewer_nudge`
  (`publish-reviewer-nudge-github`, GitHub-only — no GitLab equivalent skill
  exists).
- **Shared across both forges (2 tools):** `sdlc_list_gate_status`,
  `sdlc_publish_gate_status` (`publish-gate-status-gitlab`/`-github` — one
  pair of tools, `forge: "gitlab" | "github"` selects the shape).

`brief-pending-gates-gitlab`/`-github` are the only two forge-specific skills
NOT mirrored: both just wrap `bin/cadre sdlc status`, i.e. exactly what
`sdlc_status` above already calls — there is nothing new to wrap.

This repository's `provider.json` pins `kernel_compatibility.minimum` to
`agentic-sdlc` [v0.13.0](https://github.com/deagy/agentic-sdlc/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
or later — 10 of the 16 GitLab/GitHub tools require it (see CHANGELOG.md for
why). If a tool call fails with "invalid choice" on an older pinned kernel,
`agentic-sdlc <subcommand> --help` will tell you what that kernel actually
supports.

## Requires the external `agentic-sdlc` kernel

`bin/cadre sdlc` is a thin pass-through to the separately-installed
`agentic-sdlc` kernel binary — gate state and transitions live entirely in that
external kernel, not in this repository (see root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Architecture
Notes"). Install it first via one of the lifecycle plugins' bundled bootstrap
scripts, e.g.:

```sh
python3 plugins/lifecycle/tools/bootstrap_sdlc.py --root /path/to/project --profile secure-cloud
```

Every tool below fails with a structured error (not a throw) if the kernel
isn't resolvable — this plugin does not install it.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deagy/cadre-lifecycle.git
cline plugin install /path/to/cadre-lifecycle/cline-lifecycle --force
```

## System prompt

This plugin registers a rule (`api.registerRule`, the "rules" capability
declared in [`index.ts`](index.ts)'s manifest and
[`package.json`](package.json)'s `cline.plugins[0].capabilities`) whose
content is appended to the session's composed system prompt automatically —
no host-application configuration required. See
[`../cline/README.md`](../cline/README.md)'s "System prompt" section for the
`@cline/core`/`@cline/shared` source confirming `registerRule` is a genuine,
plugin-controlled injection point, distinct from a host's own `systemPrompt`
config field. The registered content begins with the exact sentence
`"You are a coding assistant with access to Cadre role subagents."` and adds
a clause naming the `sdlc_*` tool family and the separation-of-duties
invariant the external Agentic SDLC kernel enforces (never approve/decide a
gate this session prepared evidence for itself).

If `cline`, `cline-agents`, and/or `cline-lifecycle` are all installed in
the same session, each plugin registers its rule independently -- a plugin's
`setup(api, ctx)` has no way to detect whether a sibling plugin is also
loaded, so each one includes the full base sentence rather than risk
omitting it when installed alone. A session with more than one of these
plugins installed will therefore see the base sentence once per installed
plugin (mildly redundant -- three short, clearly-scoped paragraphs, not one
combined string) rather than a single deduplicated system prompt. See each
plugin's own README for its exact registered content.

## Tools

| Tool | Wraps | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sdlc_init` | `bin/cadre sdlc init` | Initialize G1-G10 lifecycle tracking for a project. Pass `dryRun: true` first and inspect the result before writing for real. |
| `sdlc_validate` | `bin/cadre sdlc validate` | Validate a project's Agentic SDLC configuration and run-record state. Returns errors/blockers as JSON. |
| `sdlc_plan` | `bin/cadre sdlc plan` | Create (or overwrite) a task's dispatch plan and pending run record. This is a real write, not a dry-run preview -- the kernel's `plan` subcommand has no dry-run mode. Needed before `sdlc_status`/`sdlc_decide` can operate on a brand-new task-id. |
| `sdlc_status` | `bin/cadre sdlc status` | Report a task's pending/decided lifecycle gates. Read-only. |
| `sdlc_decide` | `bin/cadre sdlc decide` | Record a lifecycle gate decision. |
| `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab` | `bin/cadre sdlc approve-from-gitlab` | Record a human gate approval from prepared GitLab MR-approval evidence. |
| `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab_mr` | `bin/cadre sdlc approve-from-gitlab-mr` | Record a human gate approval by fetching and verifying an approved GitLab MR approval live. Fails closed if none is found. |
| `sdlc_link_intent_from_gitlab_issue` | `bin/cadre sdlc link-intent-from-gitlab-issue` | Record a GitLab issue as the recorded source for a task's G1 (Intent) gate. |
| `sdlc_link_requirements_from_gitlab_issue` | `bin/cadre sdlc link-requirements-from-gitlab-issue` | Record a GitLab issue as the recorded source for a task's G2 (Requirements Baseline) gate. |
| `sdlc_approve_from_github` | `bin/cadre sdlc approve-from-github` | Record a human gate approval from prepared GitHub PR-review evidence. |
| `sdlc_approve_from_github_pr` | `bin/cadre sdlc approve-from-github-pr` | Record a human gate approval by fetching and verifying an approved GitHub PR review live. Fails closed if none is found. |
| `sdlc_list_gate_issues_gitlab` | `bin/cadre sdlc list-gate-issues` | List a task's existing GitLab gate-tracking issues and their assigned approval sub-issues. Read-only. |
| `sdlc_create_gate_issues_gitlab` | `bin/cadre sdlc create-gate-issues` | Create/reuse GitLab gate-tracking issues plus assigned approval sub-issues. Defaults to a dry-run preview; `apply: true` requires the `planDigest` the preceding dry-run returned. |
| `sdlc_list_github_gate_issues` | `bin/cadre sdlc list-github-gate-issues` | List a task's existing GitHub gate-tracking issues and their assigned approval sub-issues. Read-only. |
| `sdlc_create_github_gate_issues` | `bin/cadre sdlc create-github-gate-issues` | Create/reuse GitHub gate-tracking issues plus assigned approval sub-issues. Defaults to a dry-run preview; `apply: true` requires the `planDigest` the preceding dry-run returned. |
| `sdlc_list_gate_status` | `bin/cadre sdlc list-gate-status` | Show a task's locally-recorded gate-status publication ledger (both forges). Zero-network, can be stale. Read-only. |
| `sdlc_publish_gate_status` | `bin/cadre sdlc publish-gate-status` | Publish/update a one-way gate-status summary note on a GitLab MR or GitHub PR (`forge` selects the shape). Never read back as an approval. Defaults to a dry-run preview. |
| `sdlc_request_gate_reviewers_gitlab` | `bin/cadre sdlc request-gate-reviewers-gitlab` | Report which GitLab usernames would be set as MR reviewers. Read-only/reporting only. |
| `sdlc_request_gate_reviewers_github` | `bin/cadre sdlc request-gate-reviewers` | Report which GitHub logins would be requested as PR reviewers. Read-only/reporting only. |
| `sdlc_list_reviewer_nudge` | `bin/cadre sdlc list-reviewer-nudge` | Show a task's locally-recorded reviewer-nudge publication ledger. GitHub-only. Read-only. |
| `sdlc_publish_reviewer_nudge` | `bin/cadre sdlc publish-reviewer-nudge` | Publish/update an advisory PR comment naming good reviewer candidates. Never a formal review request. GitHub-only. Defaults to a dry-run preview. |

Every tool accepts an optional `root` (defaults to the host session's
workspace root) and otherwise mirrors the exact flags the corresponding
`SKILL.md` documents for its runner-neutral CLI invocation — see
[`index.ts`](index.ts) for the full schemas.

### `sdlc_decide` and the four `sdlc_approve_from_*` tools add no approval logic of their own

The `agentic-sdlc` kernel itself structurally refuses a decision from the same
identity as the gate's preparer/verifier (this repository's human-approval
invariant — see root `CLAUDE.md`). `sdlc_decide`, `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab`,
`sdlc_approve_from_gitlab_mr`, `sdlc_approve_from_github`, and
`sdlc_approve_from_github_pr` all only relay whatever the kernel decides,
success or refusal, as JSON; none attempts its own separation-of-duties
check, and none must ever be called on behalf of a human who has not
actually made the decision (or, for the forge-specific tools, actually
recorded/authored the GitLab MR approval or GitHub PR review) being
recorded.

### `sdlc_link_intent_from_gitlab_issue` / `sdlc_link_requirements_from_gitlab_issue` record a source, not an approval

These two only attach a GitLab issue reference to G1/G2 respectively — they
never advance, approve, or invalidate a gate. Use `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab`
or `sdlc_approve_from_gitlab_mr` to actually record an approval. GitHub has
no equivalent kernel subcommand for this today (`link-intent-from-github-issue`/
`link-requirements-from-github-issue` are documented by
`link-source-issue-github`'s `SKILL.md` but are not present in every
`agentic-sdlc` release within this repository's declared
`kernel_compatibility` range — see the note above), so this plugin has
nothing to mirror there yet.

### `sdlc_create_gate_issues_gitlab` / `sdlc_create_github_gate_issues` require a plan-digest handshake before assigning anyone

Both default to a dry-run preview (omit `apply`). Assigning a real gate
approval sub-issue to a real person is consequential and externally visible,
so the underlying kernel command requires a second call with `apply: true`
and the exact `planDigest` value the dry-run returned — never fabricate or
guess one. If the kernel reports the digest is stale, re-run the dry-run and
get fresh confirmation rather than retrying blindly.

### Four tools treat exit code 2 as a normal report, not a failure

`sdlc_request_gate_reviewers_gitlab`, `sdlc_request_gate_reviewers_github`,
`sdlc_create_gate_issues_gitlab`, and `sdlc_create_github_gate_issues` all
wrap kernel commands where exit 0 means "completed cleanly" and exit 2 means
"completed, but the result contains refusals" (all four) or "...refusals or
assignee drift" (the two create-gate-issues commands) — both are valid,
non-failure reports, not something to retry, and all four tools return that
report's JSON normally either way, including (for the two create-gate-issues
tools) the `plan_digest` a subsequent `apply: true` call needs and, in
`--apply` mode, confirmation of any issue that was already created before the
refusal was hit — except for any `GateIssuesBlocked`/`GateIssuesGithubBlocked`
failure during `--apply` (also exit 2; not limited to a concurrent
plan-digest mismatch — ambiguous label matches, identity mismatches, a held
lock, and several other cases all raise it too), which the kernel reports as
a bare `{"error": "..."}` rather than the full structured result, so those
specific cases surface the same way a structural failure would. Only a
genuine structural failure (exit 1: MR/PR
not found or closed, an identity mismatch, a malformed request) is expected
to surface as any of the four tools' `error` field otherwise.

## Behavioral detail

Every tool wraps a `bin/cadre sdlc` subcommand and adds no approval logic of
its own — separation of duties is enforced entirely by the external kernel.
Each tool throws if no `root` argument is given and no workspace root could
be resolved; otherwise it runs the real subprocess and returns a structured
error (never a thrown exception or a false success) for cases like an
un-onboarded project, a task with no run record, or a nonexistent
task/gate. `sdlc_init` supports a real dry-run preview against a scratch
project. A handful of kernel subcommands are gated behind
`kernel_compatibility` since not every `agentic-sdlc` release in range ships
them yet — see the tests for exactly which.

[`index.test.mts`](index.test.mts) covers all of the above against a real,
unmocked `bin/cadre sdlc` subprocess.
[`index.exitcode.test.mts`](index.exitcode.test.mts) is a separate file
specifically for `runCadreSdlcAllowingReportExitCodes`'s exit-code-branching
behavior — it mocks `node:child_process` at module level (to deterministically
exercise the exit-2-with-JSON-on-stdout path a live kernel call can't
reliably reproduce), so it can't share a file with `index.test.mts`'s
real-subprocess tests.
