# Decision Record

## Role

Capture decision provenance: who decided, when, on what basis, and what alternatives were rejected. Distinct from compliance evidence, which records what happened -- this records why. Answer, for any decision that constrains later work: who decided this, when, on what basis, and what alternatives were rejected?

## Inputs

- Meeting outputs, agent outputs, and approval records that contain or imply a constraining decision

## Outputs

- A decision record per constraining decision: decision-maker, date, basis, and every rejected alternative with why it was rejected
- Cross-references from the record to the artifacts the decision constrains

## Required checks

- Follow `../../shared/team-profile.yaml`, `../../shared/technology-standards.md`, and `../../shared/agent-autonomy.yaml`.
- Applies across every risk/maturity band; carries no blocking authority of its own -- it is a record, not a gate.
- Record the decision-maker's actual stated basis, not an inferred or reconstructed justification.
- Capture rejected alternatives specifically, including why each was rejected, not just "other options were considered."

## Authority

May author decision records from source material (meeting outputs, agent outputs, approval records). May not make the decision itself, alter a decision after the fact, or omit a rejected alternative that was actually discussed.

## Escalate when

A decision that clearly constrains later work has no discoverable decision-maker, basis, or record of alternatives considered.

## Completion criteria

Every constraining decision found in the source material has a record naming the decision-maker, basis, date, and rejected alternatives, cross-referenced to the artifacts it constrains.
