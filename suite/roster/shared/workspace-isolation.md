# Workspace Isolation

**Applies to:** every write-capable capability tier (any tier whose
`sandbox_mode` in `roster/runner-capabilities.json` is not `read-only` --
currently `document_author`, `code_author`, `test_author`, and
`environment_operator`; see `generate_global_plugin.py`'s
`WRITE_CAPABLE_TIERS`). A read-only role has no edits to isolate and this
file's steps do not apply to it, even though `cadre resolve-shared
workspace-isolation.md` will still return it verbatim on request -- shared
policy resolution is filename-based, not capability-aware.

This file governs one thing: **before you make your first edit, decide
whether to work in a dedicated `git worktree` instead of the caller's main
working tree, and say which you did.** It is prompt policy plus an
orchestrator dispatch-contract expectation, not a mechanically enforced gate
-- nothing in the dispatch pipeline blocks an edit that skips this. Follow it
because a silent choice here creates real review and audit risk: reviewers
and follow-up agents assume the main working tree reflects your work unless
you say otherwise, and an isolated-but-unreported change looks, from the
main tree, like nothing happened.

Every rule in `agent-autonomy.yaml` still applies unchanged.
`repository.create_local_branch_or_worktree: allowed` already covers creating
the worktree and branch described below; `commit: on_request`,
`push: on_request`, and `merge: never` are untouched -- this file does not
grant, imply, or expand any permission. Isolating your edits into a worktree
is a location decision, not a commit/push/merge decision.

## Step 0 -- Already isolated?

Before deciding anything, check whether you are already inside a linked
worktree rather than a repository's main working tree:

```sh
git rev-parse --git-dir
git rev-parse --git-common-dir
```

If the two paths differ, you are already in a linked worktree (the first
points at that worktree's private `.git/worktrees/<name>` administrative
directory; the second points at the shared repository `.git`). For example,
inside a worktree named `impl`, this looks like:

```
--git-dir:        /path/to/repo/.git/worktrees/impl
--git-common-dir: /path/to/repo/.git
```

If they differ: **use the worktree you are already in. Do not nest another
worktree inside it.** Report its path and branch in the end-of-task result
block below and skip Steps 1-2 entirely.

If the two paths are identical, you are in a main working tree (or a bare
non-worktree checkout) and Step 1 applies.

## Step 1 -- Can I isolate?

Isolate into a new worktree only when **all** of the following hold:

1. `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` reports `true`.
2. The resolved `agent-autonomy.yaml` (`cadre resolve-shared
   agent-autonomy.yaml` -- a project overlay may have narrowed this)
   reports `repository.create_local_branch_or_worktree: allowed`.
3. `git status --porcelain` shows **no dirty paths that intersect the
   task's scope** (see "the dirty-scope guard" below for why this
   specific check, not a blanket "tree must be fully clean" check).

If all three hold, create the worktree in-root, at
`<repository_root>/.worktrees/<task-id>/<role-id>/`, from the repository
root:

```sh
git -C <repository_root> worktree add -b "agent/<task-id>/<role-id>" \
  ".worktrees/<task-id>/<role-id>" HEAD
```

Notes on that exact command:

- **In-root, not a sibling directory.** A worktree created as a sibling of
  the repository (the ordinary `git worktree` convention elsewhere) is
  unwritable in this environment: child agent processes are spawned with a
  sandbox scoped to the project root (for example, Codex's `--cd
  <project_root> --sandbox workspace-write`), so only paths under the
  repository root are writable at all. `.worktrees/` is git-ignored (see
  `.gitignore`) so it never pollutes `git status` or a commit.
- **Never `--detach`.** The worktree needs a real branch so work can be
  committed, reviewed, and handed off normally.
- **Never `-B` (force-create/reset the branch).** Plain `-b` surfaces an
  "already exists" error if the branch name collides with something, which
  is the correct outcome -- silently resetting an existing branch could
  discard work. Choose a different `<task-id>`/`<role-id>` pairing or escalate
  instead of forcing past that error.
- Base the worktree on `HEAD` of the working tree you are isolating from,
  not a remote ref, so it starts from exactly what you observed.

If isolation succeeds, make all edits inside the new worktree and report its
path, branch, and base revision in the end-of-task result block. Do not also
edit the main working tree for the same task.

## Step 2 -- Degrade explicitly

If any Step 1 condition fails, **do not isolate silently and do not fail
silently** -- edit in place in the working tree you were dispatched into, and
say so plainly in your result:

> Worktree isolation not used: `<reason>`. Edits were made in place at
> `<path>`.

Silence about this choice is itself a defect: a caller who expects isolation
by default and gets in-place edits without being told has an inaccurate
picture of where the deliverable lives.

## The dirty-scope guard, explained

`git worktree add ... HEAD` creates the new worktree from the last commit --
it does **not** carry uncommitted changes into the new worktree. If you were
dispatched specifically to fix or extend work-in-progress that exists only
as uncommitted changes in the main tree, and you isolate anyway, you isolate
yourself away from the exact changes you were sent to address. You would
then edit a clean checkout, report success, and leave the actual
work-in-progress in the main tree untouched and unreviewed -- a silent
failure that looks like a success.

This is why Step 1's dirty-tree condition is scoped to "dirty paths that
intersect the task's scope," not "the tree must have zero uncommitted
changes anywhere." An unrelated dirty file outside your task's scope (for
example, another in-progress teammate's edit under disjoint ownership) does
not by itself block isolation; a dirty file your task needs to build on
does.

## The security-relevant-resolver rule

Some project state a resolver depends on is deliberately not tracked by
git, so it is **absent** in a freshly created worktree even though it exists
in the main tree. If a resolver whose result is security-relevant would
resolve differently once you isolate, **degrade or block -- never resolve
silently as if nothing changed.**

The concrete case to know: `.agents/knowledge-store/config.json` is
git-ignored by design (it is untracked, project-local configuration -- see
`roster/shared/README.md`'s "three things that live under `.agents/`"
table). `find_project_local_config()`
(`roster/knowledge-store/src/config.py`) walks upward from the current
working directory looking for that file, and **stops at the first directory
containing `.git`** -- which in a linked worktree is the worktree's own
`.git` file (pointing at the shared administrative directory), not the main
checkout's tree. That walk-and-stop boundary means the search never crosses
into the main working tree to find a config file that does exist there, and
falls through to the machine-global shared store instead
(`KNOWLEDGE_STORE_HOME`, defaulting to `~/.agents/knowledge-store/`). A
project that relies on its own project-local store for tenant/classification
partitioning (see `roster/knowledge-store/SECURITY.md`) would silently and
invisibly lose that partitioning the moment retrieval runs from inside a
fresh worktree instead of the main tree.

When you detect this condition -- a security-relevant resolver whose config
file is untracked and therefore absent from a worktree you just created --
do not proceed as if the global store is an equivalent substitute.
Explicitly degrade (treat retrieval as unavailable and say so) or block
(raise it as a blocking question) rather than resolving to the broader,
differently-scoped store without comment. This applies to any future
resolver with the same shape (untracked project-local file, walk-to-`.git`
boundary, security- or classification-relevant result), not only this one.

## Teams: one shared worktree per team, not one per teammate

When a task dispatches multiple agents together (an Agent Team or an
ordinary parallel wave), isolate **once**, as a team, not once per
teammate:

- The team lead creates a single worktree for the team's shared task and
  passes its path to every teammate in their brief.
- Teammates edit inside that shared worktree, using the same disjoint
  per-path file ownership `operating-principles.md` already requires for
  parallel work ("keep file ownership exclusive per agent -- never edit a
  path another teammate owns for the same task").
- Do **not** create a separate worktree per teammate for the same task. Per
  teammate worktrees trade a review-catchable overlap (two teammates
  touching the same file inside one shared tree, visible in `git status`
  and in review) for silent divergence across N unmerged branches that no
  one is positioned to reconcile.

## Never remove or prune a worktree yourself

Never run `git worktree remove` or `git worktree prune` (or delete a
worktree directory directly) as part of your own task. The worktree you
created *is* the deliverable location until a human or the dispatching
process decides otherwise, and removing worktree registrations is a
destructive git-metadata operation (`destructive_action: human_approval` in
`agent-autonomy.yaml`). Leave cleanup to the operator; see
`roster/RUNBOOK.md`'s worktree-operations section.

## No runner names as behavioral conditions

Everything above is determined by running `git` commands and reading
resolved policy -- never by which coding-agent runner you are. Do not branch
your behavior on "if I am Claude Code" / "if I am Codex" / "if I am Cline"
or any other runner name. Detection (Step 0's `git rev-parse` comparison,
Step 1's `git status`/`agent-autonomy.yaml` checks) is what tells you which
situation you are in; the runner identity is never itself a condition here.

## Escalating

If you reach a point where only a human can resolve the choice (for
example: the dirty-scope guard is ambiguous, or a security-relevant
resolver's degraded behavior would materially change the task outcome and
you cannot tell whether that is acceptable), follow the standard blocking-
question convention: you are a dispatched subagent who cannot ask the human
directly, so stop and return a clearly labeled blocking question in your
result instead of guessing or proceeding.

## End-of-task result block (mandatory)

Every task governed by this file ends its result with this block, filled
in truthfully regardless of which path was taken:

```
Workspace isolation:
  mode: worktree | inherited-worktree | in-place
  path: <absolute path to the working tree actually edited>
  branch: <branch name, or "n/a" for in-place with no new branch>
  base revision: <commit the worktree/branch was created from, or "n/a">
  committed: yes | no
  reason (if in-place): <why Step 1 failed, or why isolation was otherwise skipped>
```

`mode` values:

- `worktree` -- you created a new worktree in this task (Step 1).
- `inherited-worktree` -- you were already inside a linked worktree and used
  it as-is (Step 0).
- `in-place` -- you edited the working tree you were dispatched into,
  without isolating (Step 2).
