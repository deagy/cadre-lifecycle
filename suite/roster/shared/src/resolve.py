# Every leaf value that appears in agent-autonomy.yaml today, ranked from
# least restrictive (0) to most restrictive (10). This is a genuine policy
# judgment call, not an arbitrary implementation detail, so the rationale for
# each tier is recorded here for the next maintainer:
#
#  0  allowed
#       Unconditional permission. No precondition, no gate.
#  1  allowed_within_selected_scope
#       Unconditional within the agent's already-assigned task/scope; the
#       "condition" (staying in scope) is something the agent is expected to
#       satisfy anyway, so it is only a hair more restrictive than plain
#       "allowed".
#  2  allowed_with_explicit_read_only_credentials
#       Unconditional once a real, separately-provisioned constraint (read-
#       only credentials) is satisfied. That provisioning step is an actual
#       operational barrier beyond "stay in scope", so it ranks above
#       allowed_within_selected_scope.
#  3  on_request
#       The agent does not act on its own initiative; it acts only once a
#       human asks for that specific action in the moment. Lighter than a
#       formal authorization or approval process, but strictly more
#       restrictive than any unconditional/self-serve "allowed" variant, and
#       strictly lighter than needing a standing authorization or an
#       approval decision. Sits, as intended, between "always allowed" and
#       "needs a human decision".
#  4  explicit_task_authorization
#       Requires the dispatched task itself to carry a documented, scoped
#       authorization for this action (e.g. a disposable test environment
#       explicitly called out in the task). Heavier than a bare human
#       request because it must be established as part of task setup, not
#       just asked for in-session.
#  5  explicitly_authorized
#       Requires a standing authorization decision, made outside normal task
#       flow, before the agent may read a shared system at all. Heavier than
#       explicit_task_authorization because it is not just a per-task grant;
#       it is an access decision about a shared system that outlives any one
#       task.
#  6  explicitly_authorized_and_minimum_scope
#       explicitly_authorized plus a minimum-necessary-scope constraint on
#       top; strictly more restrictive than plain explicitly_authorized.
#  7  human_approval_except_authorized_disposable_test
#       Requires human approval in general, but carves out an exception for
#       an already-authorized disposable test environment. Because that
#       exception exists, it is less restrictive than unconditional
#       human_approval, but the default case still blocks on a human, so it
#       ranks above every value that never requires human approval.
#  8  human_approval
#       Requires a human approval decision for every instance, with no
#       exception.
#  9  knowledge_store_steward_only
#       Restricted to a single named role rather than "any human approves".
#       A narrower approver population is a stricter gate than general
#       human_approval, so it ranks above it.
# 10  never
#       Categorically forbidden. The maximum restriction.
#
# No two values in the current vocabulary were judged genuinely
# incomparable; if a future value cannot be placed in this order with
# confidence, add it as a new tier (or introduce real incomparability
# handling) rather than guessing.
