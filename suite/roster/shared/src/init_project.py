"""Guide a project through generating `.agents/shared/<filename>` overlays.

Implements REQ-SC-GENERIC-0001 rev 2 / ARCH-SC-GENERIC-0001 (G3-approved):
`cadre init` walks a project through RG-A (stack/tooling opinions), RG-B
(governance/autonomy narrowing), and RG-C (platform impact-profile guided fill-in)
and writes the resulting overlays through a single, containment-checked write
chokepoint. It never invents a new config format: every file it writes is
exactly the same `.agents/shared/<filename>` overlay `roster/shared/src/
resolve.py` already knows how to resolve, and every generated overlay is
validated by calling `resolve_shared_config()` against it in-process before
success is reported.

Nothing is written without `--force`; omitting it (the default) previews
only. See roster/shared/README.md for the underlying overlay/merge rules this
module builds on top of, and AGENT.md / REQ-SC-GENERIC-0001 rev 2 for the
requirement numbers referenced throughout this file's docstrings and error
messages.

    only ever be called AFTER `plan_writes` has run, so the accepted/
    rejected status this redaction reports is the real, post-validation
    outcome, not a guess made from the raw, unvalidated answer set.

    - `rg_b_autonomy`: every leaf field this run touched is replaced with its
      field path and a post-validation `accepted`/`rejected` status plus a
      sha256 hash of the raw value (recoverable from the audit log) — never
      the raw value itself, matching the audit log's own hash-only
      discipline for rejected autonomy values. If the autonomy overlay build
      failed for ANY reason, every touched field is reported `rejected` (the
      fragment was not applied as a unit; a fine-grained accepted/rejected
      split per field isn't something `plan_writes` itself tracks when the
      whole build fails).
    - `rg_b_guardrails_addendum`: bullets that passed the denylist scan are
      echoed in full, since an accepted bullet already passed the same scan
      that gates it becoming visible file content anyway; bullets
      `plan_writes` rejected are reduced to their hash.
    - `field_decisions[<path>]`: an entry has its `new_value`/`source_value`
      put through the identical accepted/rejected-hash treatment as the
      corresponding `rg_b_autonomy` leaf, keyed by the same dotted field
      path, if EITHER of two independent signals says it is
      governance-restricted (fail-safe union, never a single gate):

        1. its declared `category` field says `"governance"`, OR
        2. its dotted path appears in `result.governance_touched_paths` —
           ground truth computed in `plan_writes` straight from the real
           agent-autonomy.yaml fragment structure, independent of anything
           the answer file claims about itself.

      `category` is a free-form string the answer-file author fully
      controls (an answer file can set a real governance leaf via
      `rg_b_autonomy` while mislabeling that same path's
      `field_decisions[...].category` as `"stack"`), so it can never be the
      sole gate for a security-relevant redaction decision — signal 2
      exists to catch exactly that mislabeling, independent of whether
      `require_field_decisions_cover`'s own category-mismatch check has run
      or what it concluded. `source_value` is redacted too, even though it
      is normally just the shipped repo default, because an overlay-of-an-
      overlay run could populate it from a prior project's overlay value
      instead. An entry that matches neither signal (a genuine `category:
      stack` path that is also absent from `governance_touched_paths`, e.g.
      a team-profile.yaml/technology-standards.md/library-standards.yaml
      field) is left untouched.

      There is no equivalent ground-truth path set for cloud-guardrails.md
      (see `InitResult.governance_touched_paths`'s docstring): guardrail
      addenda are free-text bullets, not dotted leaf paths against a schema,
      so a `field_decisions` entry describing a guardrails-addendum decision
      is gated by its declared `category` alone.
    - Every other top-level key (including `rg_a_*`, `rg_c_platform`) is echoed
      verbatim: those fields are not free-text secret-shaped input and
      aren't in scope for this redaction.

    The top-level `rg_b_autonomy`/`rg_b_guardrails_addendum` KEYS themselves
    do not need the same ground-truth treatment as `field_decisions[...]
    .category`: the key name an answer file uses is what `plan_writes`
    dispatches on structurally (`answers.get("rg_b_autonomy")` is only ever
    fed to `build_autonomy_overlay`, `answers.get("rg_b_guardrails_addendum")`
    is only ever fed to `build_guardrails_overlay`), so there is no way to
    mislabel a value under the wrong top-level key and have it silently take
    a different, less-restricted code path the way a mislabeled `category`
    string can.
