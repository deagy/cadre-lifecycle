# Cadre Agent Suite

This directory defines the Secure Cloud provider's agent team for designing,
building, observing, operating, black-box testing, end-user testing,
supporting, escalating, reviewing, documenting, and releasing approved
platform and application changes. The current provider is specialized for the
team's self-hosted Proxmox, Talos, Kubernetes, OpenTofu, Helm, Go/Python/
PostgreSQL backends, React/TypeScript frontends, Gherkin tests, and GitLab
delivery platform, but the role identities themselves are organized around work
domains rather than individual tools.

The `knowledge-store/` subsystem is the shared agent retrieval layer for authorized historical material; a project without its own `.agents/knowledge-store/config.json` resolves to the store shared across every project on the machine by default (see `knowledge-store/README.md`). The selector plans role-specific queries against the CLI's absolute path with an explicit `--source`; the orchestration runner resolves Python 3.10+ and executes `src/cli.py context ...`, then attaches cited results before agent execution. Retrieved content is untrusted reference data and never overrides current policies or agent authority.

Start with the [documentation index](../docs/README.md) for the shortest path
to a task-oriented guide. Read [IDENTITY.md](../IDENTITY.md) for the suite's
informational orientation, then use `RUNBOOK.md` for the complete operating
model and worked examples.

Useful entry points:

- [Getting started](../docs/getting-started.md) for a first local selection.
- [Orchestration guide](../docs/orchestration.md) for planning and handoffs.
- [Lifecycle and plugin operations](../docs/lifecycle-and-plugin-operations.md)
  for target-project setup and GitHub-backed approvals.
- [Role index](../docs/role-index.md) for human-readable role discovery.
- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for changes to this GitHub repository.

The Python selector component requires Python 3.10 or newer, without
establishing an organization-wide Python version. `bin/cadre` (repository
root) resolves an interpreter for you — run `cadre select --task "..."` from
anywhere it's on `PATH`, or `../../bin/cadre select --task "..."`
(`..\bin\agents.ps1` in PowerShell) from this directory. See `RUNBOOK.md` for
the wrapper's interpreter-probe details. The schema version 2 selector
evaluates task text and Git changes, validates roles against `catalog.yaml`,
and emits a reviewable plan with provider lifecycle applicability kept
separate from mutation-oriented human gates; it does not execute agents,
approve gates, or retrieve knowledge.

`cadre select` works standalone by default, using only this suite's own
`catalog.yaml` and `routing.yaml`, and optionally enriches its plan when the
standalone Agentic SDLC executable is also available. See
[`RUNBOOK.md` §2 "Select agents locally"](RUNBOOK.md#select-agents-locally)
for the standalone-vs-integrated behavior, `lifecycle_tracking.status`, and
`--require-sdlc`.

The plan additionally emits a deterministic `teams` array (from
`orchestration/routing.yaml`'s `team_recipes`) and each role in `catalog.yaml`
may declare a `model` tier (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`) propagated into the
generated wrappers — see `RUNBOOK.md` "Select the agent" and the
`run-agent-orchestration` skill's `references/team-recipes.md` and
`references/runner-adapters.md` for details, including the
peer-vs-orchestrator-relayed communication contract each team carries.

## Operating model

1. Capture human-owned intent and establish traceable requirements before architecture and implementation.
2. Select the workflow in `workflows/` that matches the lifecycle phase or change.
3. Retrieve authorized, role-specific knowledge context and record its status and query identifiers.
4. Give each participating agent its `AGENT.md`, task context, knowledge bundle, and only the access it needs.
5. Exchange findings using `shared/output-schemas/finding.schema.json` and bind agent handoffs through `orchestration/handoff-contracts.md`.
6. In a consuming target project, ask the standalone Agentic SDLC kernel to validate lifecycle decisions and record gate state in that project's `.agentic-sdlc/` directory. This provider repository does not run its own `.agentic-sdlc/` overlay.
7. Require a human decision wherever an agent reaches an escalation condition or human-only gate.
8. Route runtime nonconformance through observability, support, incident, security, compliance, and debugging roles into traced remediation or backlog work.
9. Permit authorized retrieval and its operational audit/SQLite writes, but route content and lifecycle mutations through the knowledge-store steward.

Agents may prepare changes and evidence, but no author may approve its own work. Production deployment is performed by a narrowly scoped deployment identity after the required approvals.

## Team configuration

Technology preferences live in `shared/team-profile.yaml`, `shared/technology-standards.md`, and `shared/library-standards.yaml`. Execution permissions live in `shared/agent-autonomy.yaml`. Keep these centralized rather than duplicating preferences in every role. Items marked `not_yet_selected` require an explicit team decision.

## Portable adoption

This repository is the source implementation for the Cadre agent suite. The lifecycle kernel, schemas, command interface, gate transitions, approvals, and lifecycle skills are maintained separately at `github.com/deagy/agentic-sdlc`. This suite contributes its catalog, `secure-cloud` profile, routing, and provider extensions through `provider/provider.json`.

Initialize a consuming target project from the repository checkout with:

```sh
cadre sdlc init --root /path/to/target
```

The portable initializer proposes detectable values and leaves consequential unknowns unresolved. Human authority, compliance applicability, environment persistence/production status, risk acceptance, and platform applicability must be assigned or decided by accountable humans. It writes lifecycle state into the target project's own `.agentic-sdlc/` directory — separate from and carrying no authority over any other project's overlay. This provider checkout does not run its own `.agentic-sdlc/` overlay (see `docs/lifecycle-and-plugin-operations.md`). See `https://github.com/deagy/agentic-sdlc` for installation and upgrades.

For GitHub-backed human gates, see [Lifecycle and plugin
operations](../docs/lifecycle-and-plugin-operations.md)'s "GitHub-backed
human approvals" section: set `approval_sources.human_gate_default` to
`github-review`, bind authorities to their GitHub logins, and use `cadre
sdlc approve-from-github-pr` to fetch and record an approved review.

## System-wide adoption

Unlike the portable kernel above, the packaged plugin ([`deagy/cadre-lifecycle`](https://github.com/deagy/cadre-lifecycle), the successor to the now-archived `deagy/cadre-plugin`) does not get copied into other repositories — it makes *this* suite (roles, skills, knowledge store) reachable from any project directory on the machine once installed at global/user scope, since none of it is discoverable from outside this checkout by default. See `../README.md` (the register-owned source of that package's README) and `RUNBOOK.md` section 17.
