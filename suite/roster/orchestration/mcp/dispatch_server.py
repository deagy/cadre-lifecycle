"""Stdio MCP server exposing `dispatch_secure_cloud_role` to a Codex CLI session.

Fixes the "Known upstream limitation" documented in
`.agents/skills/run-agent-orchestration/references/runner-adapters.md`:
Codex CLI's model-visible `spawn_agent` tool has no parameter to select a
named custom agent from `.codex/agents/`. This server gives a running Codex
session a real tool that does that resolution and dispatch itself, instead
of relying on the model to read the target `.toml` file and hand-inject its
`developer_instructions` into a generic `spawn_agent` call.

Transport: stdio only. Optional dependency: the official `mcp` Python SDK
(see `requirements-mcp.txt`). Mirrors `roster/shared/src/resolve.py`'s
`_require_yaml()` fail-closed pattern -- importing `dispatch_core` (the
actual safety-relevant logic) never requires `mcp`, so this optional
component being unavailable can never break the rest of the orchestration
tooling; only *running this server* requires `mcp` to be installed, and it
fails with a clear install pointer if it isn't.
