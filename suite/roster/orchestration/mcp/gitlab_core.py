"""Pure-Python core logic for the GitLab-evidence MCP server.

Exposes a small, deliberately create-only set of GitLab operations (a
review-subtask issue, a wiki page, an evidence comment) so any agent -- in
this repo or a consuming project -- can record human-reviewable evidence
against a single, pre-configured, docs-only GitLab project without ever being
able to transition an issue's state (close/reopen/resolve/relabel-away-from
open-review). This module mirrors `dispatch_core.py`'s architecture exactly:

- Zero dependency on the optional `mcp` package (or anything else outside the
  standard library plus this module's own sibling `dispatch_core.py`), so it
  can be imported and unit tested with all HTTP calls mocked, with no live
  GitLab instance and no third-party HTTP client. `gitlab_server.py` is the
  thin protocol adapter that depends on `mcp`; this module is the reviewable
  safety core.
- Reuses `dispatch_core.ConfirmationGate` verbatim (not a reimplementation)
  for `write_wiki_page`'s mandatory human-confirmation gate. `ConfirmationGate`
  is already fully generic -- its five bound fields (`role_id`, `brief`,
  `mode`, `classification`, `effective_sandbox`) are only ever hashed and
  compared for exact equality, never validated against dispatch-specific
  vocabularies -- so this module binds them to GitLab-shaped values (tool
  name, a hash of the write's arguments, a fixed "human_approval" mode
  string, a fixed "internal" classification, and a fixed "wiki-write" sandbox
  label) instead of inventing a second confirmation mechanism.
- Reuses `dispatch_core.wrap_untrusted_output`'s marker-token pattern (via
  `_wrap_untrusted_gitlab_payload` below) for every piece of GitLab-retrieved
  content handed back in a tool result, so retrieved issue/wiki/comment text
  can never be mistaken for an instruction by the calling model.
- Reuses `dispatch_core.build_audit_record`/`write_audit_record` verbatim
  (not a reimplementation) for a structured, append-only JSON-lines audit
  trail of every call to the three tools in this module -- every
  confirmation-requested / confirmed / denied / unavailable / ok outcome,
  not only final success -- written to its own file
  (`~/.agents/mcp-gitlab/audit.jsonl`, see `GITLAB_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` below),
  separate from `dispatch_core`'s own `~/.agents/mcp-dispatch/audit.jsonl`.
  Records never contain the GitLab token, wiki/comment/issue body content,
  or a confirmation token value -- only identifiers, hashes/lengths, and the
  decision -- matching `dispatch_core`'s own forbidden-audit-key discipline
  (`_FORBIDDEN_AUDIT_KEYS`), which `build_audit_record` enforces for this
  module too since it is the same function.

Deliberate, hard, structural invariant: this module never implements any
function that closes, reopens, resolves, or relabels-away-from-open-review
an issue, and never calls such a function on any caller's behalf. Search
this file for the string "STATE TRANSITION" if you are looking for the one
comment that exists specifically to keep that invariant visible to a future
editor; there is no such function to find beyond that comment.

Deliberate, stated scope boundary (not a silent omission): unlike
`dispatch_core.py`'s tools, none of this module's three tools accepts or
enforces a `classification` parameter on the GitLab write it performs. The
human-accepted residual-risk decision for this integration is that scope
containment is achieved operationally -- a dedicated, docs-only GitLab
project and a least-privilege service token scoped to only that project --
rather than by an in-code classification check here. See
`SECURITY-CONTROLS.md`'s GitLab section for the same statement.

    caller-level idempotency checks (see `create_review_subtask`'s
    search-before-create) as the safety design for the one operation where a
    duplicate would be most visible; `write_evidence_comment` and
    `write_wiki_page` have no equivalent caller-level dedup and could in
    principle double-apply on this specific failure shape. Flagged here,

    STATE TRANSITION: this function never closes, reopens, resolves, or
    relabels any issue away from its open review state, and calls no
    function anywhere in this module or its imports that does. It only ever
    reads issues (for the idempotency search) and creates at most one new
    issue. This is a Python-call-graph guarantee only; it does not by itself
    prevent GitLab's own server-side quick-action interpretation of body
    text from causing a state transition (see the quick-action neutralization
    note below, and `SECURITY-CONTROLS.md`'s GitLab section for the two-layer
    explanation).

    Quick-action neutralization: `description` is checked with
    `_reject_quick_action_syntax()` before this function's own trusted
    "Parent: #<iid>" / "/relate #<iid>" lines are added around it, so no
    caller-supplied line shaped like a GitLab quick action (e.g. `/close`,
    `/unlabel ~"review-subtask"`) ever reaches GitLab in the issue body.
    Without this, GitLab would interpret such a line as coming from this
    module's own service-account note author and execute it server-side --
    an effect-level state transition no Python-level structural check here
    can observe, since it never goes through this module's own HTTP call
    shapes.

    Idempotency-search race, disclosed honestly rather than implied away by
    the word "idempotent": the search-then-create sequence below (see
    `_find_existing_subtask`) is not atomic. Two genuinely concurrent calls
    with the same `(task_id, gate_id, parent_issue_iid)` can both observe "no
    existing issue" via their own GET before either has POSTed, and both then
    POST, producing two open issues carrying the identical evidence-key
    label. This module has no distributed-lock or server-side compare-and-
    swap primitive to close this gap, and none is implemented in this round;
    a caller relying on strict single-issue-per-key semantics under genuine
    concurrent callers should be aware this is a best-effort dedup, not a
    hard uniqueness guarantee.

    Hierarchy note (deviation from the ideal design, recorded here rather
    than silently guessed): the settled design allows detecting work-item
    hierarchy support "via a GraphQL feature probe or an explicit config
    flag ... default to the fallback if unset/undetectable". This
    implementation only honors the explicit `GITLAB_SUPPORTS_WORK_ITEM_HIERARCHY`
    flag as *informational* -- it is threaded through to the result so a
    caller can see whether the instance is believed to support it -- but
    does not attempt the GraphQL work-item-hierarchy mutation even when the
    flag is `true`. That mutation's exact schema (namespace-scoped work-item
    type IDs, hierarchy widget shape) could not be verified against a real
    GitLab instance or its GraphQL docs in this environment, and shipping an
    unverified mutation guess risked a worse outcome (a confidently wrong
    hierarchy link) than always using the documented fallback (an explicit
    "Parent: #<iid>" reference plus a `/relate` quick action in the
    description, which is what every call currently uses regardless of the
    flag). Extending this to a verified GraphQL hierarchy path is tracked as
    follow-up work, not done here.

    """Create or update (versioned, by GitLab's own wiki history) a wiki page
    in the configured project. The `human_approval`-tier tool: every call --
    with no exception for any caller -- must round-trip through
    `_WIKI_CONFIRMATION_GATE` exactly like a write-capable dispatch does in
    `dispatch_core.py`. A first call with no `confirmation_token` never
    writes anything; it returns `status="confirmation_required"` plus a
    token bound to the exact (slug, title, format, content hash) tuple, and
    a second call replaying that token is required before any GitLab write
    happens.

    Note: this tool's public signature has no `task_id` parameter (unlike
    `create_review_subtask`/`write_evidence_comment`), so its audit records
    carry `task_id=None`; that is a property of this tool's existing
    contract, not something this audit-logging change introduces.

    Quick-action scope note: unlike `create_review_subtask`'s `description`
    and `write_evidence_comment`'s `content`, `content` here is deliberately
    NOT run through `_reject_quick_action_syntax()`. GitLab wiki pages are
    plain Markdown/RDoc/AsciiDoc/Org rendering of a repository-like content
    blob, not an issue/note body -- GitLab's quick-action interpreter only
    ever parses issue descriptions and issue/MR/commit/epic notes, never wiki
    page content, so a `/close`-shaped line in a wiki page is rendered as
    literal text, not executed. If this is ever found to be inaccurate for a
    specific GitLab version/edition, this scope boundary must be revisited,
    not assumed to still hold.

    Stale-hint honesty note: `will_overwrite_existing` in the
    `confirmation_required` response (see below) is computed once, before the
    confirmation round trip begins, from whichever page state existed at that
    moment. Because the confirmation token's TTL is up to
    `dispatch_core.CONFIRMATION_TTL_SECONDS` (currently 300s), another actor
    could create or delete a page at the same `slug` during that window,
    making the disclosed hint stale by the time a human actually reads and
    approves it. The actual write path (`_get_wiki_page()` inside the
    confirmed branch below) always re-checks fresh at consume-time, so the
    create-vs-update *behavior* itself is never wrong -- only the
    informational hint shown to the approving human can lag reality.
    """
