# Security controls: agents MCP dispatch server

This document enumerates every control in `dispatch_core.py` /
`dispatch_server.py` that maps to a threat-model expectation or an
`agent-autonomy.yaml` guarantee, and states plainly whether the control is:

- **Mechanically enforced** -- the code makes the bad outcome structurally
  impossible for a caller of this tool to produce through this tool's own
  interface, and a specific automated test in
  `roster/orchestration/test/test_mcp_dispatch.py` exercises that claim.
- **Advisory** -- the code implements the control and it holds against an
  ordinary, non-adversarial, or single-turn caller, but a sufficiently
  adversarial or fully autonomous caller (in particular: a compromised child
  process with its own code-execution authority, or a host CLI/calling
  session willing to script around a human-confirmation step) could route
  around it. Advisory controls are still worth having -- they raise the bar
  and produce an audit trail -- but must never be described or relied upon as
  hard guarantees.

This is written to be accurate as of the code on disk after the H-1 (project-
tier git-clean) and L-1 (`confirmation_required` response shape) fixes. If
the code changes, this document must be re-checked against it, not
regenerated from memory or intent.

## Sandbox narrowing for `planning-review-only` mode

**Mechanically enforced.** `compute_effective_sandbox()` has exactly two
inputs: the caller-supplied `mode` (constrained to the two-value `MODES` set)
and the resolved role file's own `sandbox_mode` (never caller-supplied --
`dispatch_server.py`'s tool schema has no `developer_instructions` or
`sandbox_mode` parameter). When `mode == "planning-review-only"`, the
function unconditionally returns `read-only` regardless of what the file
declares; there is no third parameter through which a caller could request a
wider sandbox. This is asserted directly by
`SandboxNarrowingTests.test_planning_review_only_forces_read_only_regardless_of_file`
and `SandboxNarrowingTests.test_there_is_no_caller_parameter_that_can_widen_sandbox`
(which asserts the function's actual parameter list via `inspect.signature`,
not just its documented behavior), and at the top-level dispatch entry point
by
`TerminalVsFallbackDispatchTests.test_planning_review_only_mode_forces_read_only_even_for_a_write_capable_file`,
which inspects the literal `argv` handed to the child process (not just a
status field) for a role file that declares `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`.

## H-1 remediation: project-tier git-clean check

**Enforced against accidental/single-turn escalation. NOT enforced against a
determined actor.** Before Fix H-1, a caller with ordinary repository write
access could write `.codex/agents/<role_id>.toml` declaring
`sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` and arbitrary `developer_instructions`
for an existing catalog `role_id`, then immediately call
`dispatch_secure_cloud_role` with `mode="scoped-repository-edit"` against
it, defeating the "no caller-supplied instructions" and "danger-full-access
never reachable via caller input" guarantees for that one path, all within a
single session turn.

The fix (`_is_project_tier_git_clean()`, called from `resolve_role_file()`
only when `tier == "project"` and `mode == "scoped-repository-edit"`)
requires the project-tier file to be tracked in git with no staged or
unstaged modification relative to `HEAD` (`git status --porcelain -- <path>`
must produce empty output and exit 0) before any of its fields are trusted.
Failure -- dirty, untracked, or git itself unavailable/erroring -- raises
`ProjectTierNotGitCleanError`, a distinct `DispatchDenied` subtype, with a
non-generic message, and the check's boolean outcome is carried through
`ResolvedRole.project_tier_git_clean` into every audit record for that
dispatch (`denied`, `confirmation-required`, and the terminal decision),
so this control's actual behavior is auditable rather than assumed.

Tests: `ProjectTierGitCleanTests` (clean-committed succeeds; dirty rejected;
untracked rejected; planning-review-only is unaffected by this specific
check in both the dirty and untracked case; global-tier and plugin-tier
resolution are unaffected by the project directory's git state; the default
`mode` parameter value preserves pre-H-1 behavior for callers that don't
pass `mode`) and, at the top-level dispatch entry point,
`TerminalVsFallbackDispatchTests.test_untracked_project_tier_file_denies_dispatch_with_a_distinct_reason`,
`test_clean_committed_project_tier_file_dispatches_successfully`,
`test_dirty_project_tier_file_in_planning_review_only_is_not_denied_by_the_git_check`,
`test_audit_record_captures_the_git_clean_check_outcome_on_denial`, and
`test_audit_record_captures_the_git_clean_check_outcome_on_success`.

**Honest limit of this guarantee:** this control prevents a same-session,
single-turn write-then-dispatch escalation by requiring a separate, distinct
git-commit action to happen first -- something outside this tool's own
request/response cycle. It does **not** prevent a determined actor from
locally committing malicious `developer_instructions`/`sandbox_mode` content
without any code review and then dispatching against that commit: a clean
`git status` only proves the file matches some prior commit in the local
repository, not that the commit's content was reviewed, authorized, or safe.
This is risk-reduction against accidental or blindly-automated escalation,
not risk-elimination against an adversary who fully controls the local git
history (e.g. a compromised or malicious session with ordinary `git commit`
access and no external review gate). Global (`~/.codex/agents/`) and plugin
(`provider/codex-agents/`) tiers are intentionally out of
scope for this check: the global tier is only populated through the
provenance-marker-gated `sync_codex_agents.py` sync, and the plugin tier
ships with the package -- neither is writable by an ordinary caller through
the same direct "just edit a file in the repo" path the project tier is.

## Dispatch-depth limit (`MAX_DISPATCH_DEPTH = 1`)

**Advisory against an adversarial child.** `current_dispatch_depth()` reads
an integer counter from `SECURE_CLOUD_AGENTS_DISPATCH_DEPTH` in this
process's own environment; `build_child_env()` writes `depth + 1` into the
allowlisted child environment so a child that also happens to run this same
MCP server enforces the cap against itself. This holds for a well-behaved
child that simply inherits and reads the environment variable as intended.
It does **not** hold against a child process with its own code-execution
authority (which is exactly what a write-capable, `workspace-write` or
`danger-full-access` dispatched child has): such a child can unset, forge,
or ignore `SECURE_CLOUD_AGENTS_DISPATCH_DEPTH` entirely, since nothing
outside the child's own process enforces that it actually reads or respects
that variable when it in turn tries to call this same dispatch tool again.
`current_dispatch_depth()`'s fail-closed behavior on an unparseable value
(`DispatchDepthTests.test_unparseable_value_fails_closed_to_the_limit`)
protects against accidental corruption of the counter, not against a
deliberate adversary erasing it. Treat this exactly as the depth-guard
docstring and the prior security review already state: an accident/misuse
guard, not a hard depth bound against a compromised or hostile child.

## Human-confirmation gate for write-capable dispatch (`ConfirmationGate`)

**Advisory against a fully autonomous calling session.** The gate is a
mechanical two-call, single-use, TTL-bound token scheme (see
`ConfirmationGate`'s own docstring, which this section deliberately mirrors
and expands): a first call for a write-capable dispatch never spawns a
child and instead returns `status="confirmation_required"` plus an opaque
token bound to the exact `(role_id, brief, mode, classification,
effective_sandbox)` tuple; only a second call carrying that token, with an
identical parameter tuple, actually spawns the child, and the token is
single-use and expires after `CONFIRMATION_TTL_SECONDS`. This part --
that the first call never spawns a child, that a mismatched or reused token
is rejected -- is mechanically enforced and tested
(`ConfirmationGateTests`, plus
`TerminalVsFallbackDispatchTests.test_write_capable_dispatch_without_confirmation_never_spawns_a_child`
and `test_write_capable_dispatch_requires_confirmation_round_trip`).

What is **not** enforced, and cannot be from inside this tool: whether a
human actually read and approved the intermediate `confirmation_required`
response before the second call happened. A fully autonomous host CLI or
calling session is free to issue both calls back-to-back, itself, with no
human ever seeing the intermediate result -- this tool has no visibility
into, and no control over, the host CLI's own approval-prompt or
user-confirmation behavior around tool invocations. True human-presence
enforcement is entirely a property of the host environment this server runs
inside, not of this module. Treat this gate as a necessary layer that raises
the bar against a single accidental or blindly-scripted write-capable
dispatch, never as a sufficient proof that a human was in the loop.

## Env allowlist for the child process

**Mechanically enforced.** `build_child_env()` only ever copies names
present in the fixed `ENV_ALLOWLIST` tuple out of this server process's own
environment; it never does a blanket `os.environ` inheritance, so an
arbitrary variable in this process's environment (API keys, tokens, other
credentials) cannot reach the dispatched child by default. Tested by
`EnvAllowlistTests.test_only_allowlisted_names_are_copied` and
`test_credential_shaped_variables_never_leak_through`, which poisons the
environment with credential-shaped variable names
(`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `API_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and
asserts none of them appear in the resulting child environment.

## Audit-record secret redaction

**Mechanically enforced.** `build_audit_record()` asserts (raises
`AssertionError`, not a silent drop) if any of the fixed `_FORBIDDEN_AUDIT_KEYS`
(`developer_instructions`, `brief`, `prompt`, `output`, `stdout`, `stderr`,
`stdout_text`, `environment`, `env`, `child_env`, `credentials`, `auth`,
`token`, `confirmation_token`) are present in the fields it's asked to
record, so a future code change that accidentally tries to log one of these
fails loudly at record-construction time rather than silently leaking into
the on-disk JSON-lines audit log. Tested directly by
`AuditRecordTests.test_forbidden_keys_raise` (parameterized over every
forbidden key) and, at the top-level dispatch entry point, by
`TerminalVsFallbackDispatchTests.test_audit_records_never_contain_the_brief_or_instructions_or_output`,
which dispatches with a marked secret brief and marked child output and
asserts neither marker appears anywhere in the raw audit file contents.

## Concurrency / timeout / output caps

**Mechanically enforced.**

- Concurrency: `ConcurrencyLimiter` is a bounded semaphore (`try_acquire()`
  returns `False`, never blocks or queues unboundedly, once
  `MAX_CONCURRENT_CHILDREN` children are active); a full limiter causes the
  top-level dispatch to return a structured `denied` backpressure error
  before any child is spawned. Tested by
  `ConcurrencyLimiterTests.test_caps_concurrent_acquisitions` and
  `TerminalVsFallbackDispatchTests.test_concurrency_cap_returns_structured_backpressure_error`.
- Timeout: `spawn_and_wait()` spawns the child in its own process group
  (`start_new_session=True`) specifically so a timeout can group-kill
  (`os.killpg(..., SIGKILL)`) the whole process group, not just the direct
  child, on expiry. Tested by
  `SpawnAndWaitTests.test_group_kill_on_timeout`, which spawns a child that
  sleeps far longer than the configured timeout and asserts it is
  terminated promptly.
- Output cap: the child's stdout is read and capped at `max_output_bytes`
  in a background reader thread, with truncation explicitly recorded
  (`stdout_truncated`) rather than silently dropped, and the audit record
  never contains the captured output itself (see the redaction section
  above). Tested by
  `SpawnAndWaitTests.test_output_is_capped_and_truncation_recorded`.

## Role-file resolution safety (symlink/non-regular refusal, path containment)

**Mechanically enforced.**

- Symlink refusal: `_read_role_file_capped()` opens with `O_NOFOLLOW` and
  then verifies `S_ISREG` on the resulting file descriptor's `fstat`,
  refusing any resolved role-file path that is (or resolves through) a
  symlink at every tier. Tested by
  `SymlinkAndNonRegularRefusalTests.test_project_tier_symlink_refused`,
  `test_global_tier_symlink_refused`, `test_plugin_tier_symlink_refused`,
  and `test_symlink_at_higher_tier_does_not_fall_through_to_lower_valid_tier`
  (a symlinked higher-tier file must be a terminal denial, never a silent
  fallthrough to a valid lower tier).
- Non-regular-file refusal: the same `S_ISREG` check also refuses
  directories or other non-regular file types at the expected path. Tested
  by `test_project_tier_directory_refused`, `test_global_tier_directory_refused`,
  and `test_plugin_tier_directory_refused`.
- Path containment: `_ensure_contained()` verifies the resolved candidate
  path sits under the realpath of its declared tier root, defending against
  the tier root itself being replaced by a symlink pointed elsewhere (the
  `role_id` value itself cannot produce a traversal path, since it is
  already constrained to `^[a-z0-9-]+$` before any path is built from it).
  Exercised indirectly by the symlink-refusal tests above (which construct
  exactly this shape) and by `RoleIdValidationTests.test_rejects_path_traversal_shapes`
  for the `role_id` input side of the same defense-in-depth boundary.

## Team dispatch (`dispatch_team`)

Generalizes the single-role mechanism above to more than one member per call,
waiting for every member to reach a terminal state before returning
(implements `INTENT-CADRE-TEAM-DISPATCH-001`). Every control above still
applies per member exactly as documented; this section covers only the
team-specific additions and how each answers the intent record's OD-5
questions. `dispatch_secure_cloud_role()` itself, `ConfirmationGate`, and
`ConcurrencyLimiter.try_acquire()` are untouched by any of this -- team
support is additive, verified by
`DispatchTeamTests.test_single_role_dispatch_is_unaffected_by_team_support`
and the full pre-existing single-role suite passing unmodified.

**`dispatch_team_recipe` (in `dispatch_server.py`) is a convenience wrapper,
not a new control surface.** It expands a `routing.yaml` `team_recipes[]`
entry into concrete `{role_id, brief}` members
(`expand_recipe_to_members()` in `roster/orchestration/src/team_recipe_dryrun.py`)
and then calls `dispatch_team()` exactly as a caller who built the members
list by hand would -- every control below applies identically regardless of
which of the two tools produced the `members` list. The one thing this
wrapper adds is a refusal to expand a recipe that would not actually have
fired for the caller-supplied `matched_route_ids`/`selected_agent_ids` (or a
dynamic recipe's `instance_count` outside its declared min/max, or a member
left without a brief) -- `expand_recipe_to_members()` raises `ValueError` in
each case, which the tool surfaces as `status: "denied"` before
`dispatch_team()` is ever called. Tested by
`ExpandRecipeToMembersTests` (`test_team_recipe_dryrun.py`) and
`DispatchServerSchemaTests.test_recipe_tool_denies_a_recipe_that_would_not_fire_without_dispatching_anything`
/ `test_recipe_tool_unknown_recipe_id_is_denied_without_dispatching_anything`
(`test_mcp_dispatch.py`), both asserting `dispatch_team()` is never invoked
on a refused expansion.

- **Classification/sandbox narrowing: mechanically enforced, per member
  independently.** Each member is resolved and narrowed against the same
  caller-declared `parent_classification` exactly as a single dispatch would
  be -- there is no team-wide ceiling distinct from each member's own check,
  and no member can use another member's classification or sandbox as
  cover. Tested by `DispatchTeamTests.test_missing_parent_classification_is_denied`
  and the shared `validate_classification()`/`compute_effective_sandbox()`
  code path (same functions the single-role tests already cover).
- **Team size cap: mechanically enforced.** `MAX_TEAM_SIZE = 8`; a team
  larger than this is denied entirely before any member is resolved. This is
  a conservative v1 constant, not derived from a load test -- revisit if a
  real team recipe needs more. Tested by
  `DispatchTeamTests.test_team_over_max_size_is_denied`.
- **Dispatch-depth guard: same advisory limit as single-role, checked once
  per team.** `current_dispatch_depth() >= MAX_DISPATCH_DEPTH` denies the
  *entire* team before any member is resolved, exactly like a single
  dispatch; each spawned child still receives `depth + 1` in its own
  environment. This does **not** add a separate total-fan-out cap beyond
  `MAX_TEAM_SIZE` -- a team dispatch at depth 0 can cause up to 8 children to
  run, same honest limitation as the single-role depth guard above (advisory
  against a well-behaved child, not enforceable against one with its own
  code-execution authority).
- **Confirmation gating: mechanically enforced, one team-wide token covering
  every member.** `TeamConfirmationGate` mirrors `ConfirmationGate`'s
  single-use, TTL-bound, exact-match mechanism, but its bound subject is the
  ordered tuple of *every* member's `(role_id, brief_hash, mode,
  classification, effective_sandbox)` -- not only the write-capable ones --
  so altering any member (including a read-only one) after the first call
  invalidates the token. The `confirmation_required` response explicitly
  lists which members are write-capable (`write_capable_members`), so a
  human reviewing it sees exactly what they're approving rather than an
  opaque "this team needs confirmation." Tested by
  `TeamConfirmationGateTests` and
  `DispatchTeamTests.test_write_capable_member_requires_one_team_wide_confirmation`
  / `test_tampering_with_a_member_after_confirmation_request_invalidates_it`.
  Same honest limit as the single-role gate: this proves the two calls
  matched, not that a human actually read the intermediate response.
- **Concurrency: mechanically enforced, shared with single-role dispatch,
  blocking instead of immediate-deny.** Team members acquire the *same*
  `ConcurrencyLimiter` instance/pool single-role dispatch uses -- there is no
  separate team-scoped cap -- but via a new `acquire(timeout=...)` method
  that blocks until a slot frees (or the dispatch timeout elapses), rather
  than `try_acquire()`'s immediate denial. This is deliberate: a team can
  exceed `MAX_CONCURRENT_CHILDREN` by design (`routing.yaml`'s
  `competing-hypotheses-debugging` recipe allows up to 4 instances against a
  default cap of 3), and immediate denial would make dispatching any such
  team larger than the global cap unusable. `try_acquire()` itself is
  unchanged. Tested by `ConcurrencyLimiterBlockingAcquireTests` (waits for a
  released slot; times out when none frees) and
  `DispatchTeamTests.test_team_larger_than_the_concurrency_cap_still_completes_by_waiting`.

  **Two honest limits, found by independent security review, not fixed in
  this increment:**
  1. *Worst-case latency compounds, it isn't bounded by `timeout_seconds`
     alone.* `_run_member()` calls `limiter.acquire(timeout=timeout_seconds)`
     to wait for a slot, then passes that same `timeout_seconds` to
     `child_runner(...)` for the child's own execution timeout. A member that
     waits nearly the full timeout for a slot, then runs for nearly the full
     timeout again, can take up to ~2x `timeout_seconds` (up to ~20 minutes
     at the `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600s` default) before its result is
     known, and `dispatch_team()` blocks on every member via `thread.join()`
     -- so a single slow member can hold up the whole tool call for that
     long. Not a security bypass, but "blocks until a slot frees, or the
     dispatch timeout elapses" understates real worst-case latency; treat
     `timeout_seconds` as a per-phase budget (queuing, then execution), not a
     total-call bound.
  2. *`try_acquire()` traffic can repeatedly out-race a parked team waiter.*
     `release()` only calls `notify()` once; a woken `acquire()` waiter must
     re-acquire the condition's lock and re-check before it can claim the
     freed slot, and a concurrent `try_acquire()` call (never blocks, checks
     and claims in one step) can win that race first. Under sustained
     ordinary single-role dispatch traffic sharing the same limiter, an
     oversized team's overflow members can be systematically passed over
     until they hit their own `acquire()` timeout, rather than eventually
     getting a slot as "blocks until a slot frees" implies. This fails safe
     (the member is denied via timeout, not left hanging forever) but is a
     real fairness gap, not just a theoretical one. Fixing this would need a
     FIFO-ordered wait queue instead of a bare condition variable; deferred
     as a follow-up, not done here.
- **Audit logging: mechanically enforced, one record per member plus one
  team-summary record, correlated by `team_id`.** Every member's audit
  record (`decision="dispatched"`/`"denied"`/`"unavailable"`) carries
  `team_id`, `team_size`, and `team_member_index` alongside the same fields a
  single dispatch's record would have; one additional record with
  `decision="team-completed"` (or `"team-denied"`/`"team-unavailable"` for a
  whole-team-level failure before any member is resolved) is written once
  every member reaches a terminal state, with a `status_counts` summary.
  **`_run_member()`'s body is wrapped in a catch-all `except Exception`**
  (added after independent security review found the gap): without it, any
  exception other than the anticipated `DispatchUnavailable` from
  `child_runner(...)` -- a bug in a custom `child_runner`, a malformed
  result dict, etc. -- would propagate out of the background thread
  uncaught (`threading.Thread` swallows it, prints to stderr, the thread
  just dies), leaving that member's `results[index]` as `None` and crashing
  `dispatch_team()`'s own aggregation loop, which would lose every sibling
  member's already-completed result and skip the team-completed record
  entirely. The catch-all guarantees a result and an audit record are always
  written for every member, however it fails. Tested by
  `DispatchTeamTests.test_unexpected_exception_in_one_member_never_crashes_the_team_or_drops_siblings`.
  `_FORBIDDEN_AUDIT_KEYS`'s redaction assertion applies identically -- team
  support introduces no new audit fields that could carry secret-shaped
  content. Tested by
  `DispatchTeamTests.test_audit_records_carry_a_shared_team_id_across_members`.
- **A concurrency bug found and fixed while building this feature:**
  `_ensure_audit_log_path()`'s `os.path.lexists()` check followed by an
  `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` open was not itself race-safe -- two threads (team
  members write audit records concurrently) could both observe the file
  absent and both attempt the exclusive create, and the loser raised
  `FileExistsError` uncaught, silently killing that member's thread before
  it recorded a result (surfaced as an intermittent `None` entry in
  `dispatch_team`'s results list during this feature's own test
  development). Fixed by catching `FileExistsError` from the losing thread's
  create attempt and treating it as success (the file exists with the
  correct mode either way); still `O_EXCL`, not `O_CREAT` alone, so a
  pre-placed symlink at this path is refused exactly as before. This bug
  predates team dispatch (the same race was always theoretically reachable
  from concurrent single-role dispatches sharing one audit path) but was
  never exercised by a test until team dispatch's genuine multi-threaded
  writes made it happen routinely; the single-role test suite gained no new
  regression coverage for it specifically because the fix is in the shared
  `_ensure_audit_log_path()` path both call.

## Async dispatch (`wait=False`) audit-write durability

**Best-effort, not mechanically enforced, for the completion/team-summary
records specifically -- this is a deliberate, narrower guarantee than the
"Audit logging: mechanically enforced" claim above, which describes the
default synchronous (`wait=True`) path.** When `dispatch_secure_cloud_role`,
`dispatch_team`, or `dispatch_team_recipe` is called with `wait=False`, the
job/team is tracked by an in-process `DispatchJobStore` /
`TeamDispatchJobStore` and the caller polls for the result via
`poll_dispatch_status()` / `poll_team_status()`. Two classes of audit write
exist on this path:

- **Pre-side-effect writes** (e.g. the initial `"dispatched-async"` record,
  written before the background thread starts) are still a plain
  `write_audit_record()` call inside a `try/except Exception:
  limiter.release(); raise` -- a failure here aborts the dispatch and
  propagates to the caller, exactly as the synchronous path does.
- **Post-side-effect writes** (a background job's or team member's
  completion/failure record, and `dispatch_team`'s own
  `"team-dispatched-async"` record) go through
  `_write_audit_record_best_effort()`, which swallows a write failure rather
  than propagating it. This is intentional: by this point a background
  thread is already running or a child process has already finished, so
  letting the audit write's failure prevent `job_store.complete()` /
  `results[index] = ...` / `team_id` from ever being returned would strand
  the job or team in `"running"` forever with no way for the caller to ever
  observe the real outcome -- worse, for an operationally-critical module,
  than one missing audit line. That job/team-state-survives-a-failed-write
  guarantee is tested by
  `test_audit_write_failure_between_acquire_and_thread_start_releases_slot`,
  `test_audit_write_failure_on_completion_still_reaches_terminal_job_state`,
  `test_member_audit_write_failure_on_completion_still_reaches_terminal_result`,
  and `test_team_dispatched_async_audit_failure_still_returns_pollable_team_id`.
  A failure here is not silent: it is written to stderr (`decision`,
  `job_id`/`team_id`, and the exception) so an operator has a trace to grep
  for even though the primary on-disk audit log is missing that record; that
  stderr fallback specifically is tested by
  `WriteAuditRecordBestEffortStderrFallbackTests` (all three methods --
  failure content, `team_id` fallback when `job_id` is absent, and no
  stderr noise on a successful write). All of the above live in
  `test_mcp_dispatch.py`.

The synchronous (`wait=True`) path is unaffected: its completion audit write
is still a plain `write_audit_record()` call, so a write failure there
propagates directly to the same caller who would otherwise receive the
result -- there is no background thread to silently swallow it.

## Claude Code runner (`runner="claude-code"`)

Implements OD-4 of `INTENT-CADRE-TEAM-DISPATCH-001`. Both
`dispatch_secure_cloud_role()` and `dispatch_team()` now accept a `runner`
parameter (`"codex"`, the default and the only runner covered by every
control above unchanged, or `"claude-code"`); every existing caller that
never passes `runner` gets exactly the pre-existing Codex behavior, byte for
byte -- confirmed by the full pre-existing single-role and team test suites
passing unmodified.

- **Role-file resolution: two tiers, not three, and the plugin tier's path
  is unverified.** `resolve_claude_role_file()` checks a project-tier
  `.claude/agents/<role_id>.md` override (a real, documented convention --
  `runner-adapters.md`) first, then falls back to an installed plugin's own
  generated `agents/<role_id>.md`. There is no Claude Code equivalent of
  `sync_codex_agents.py`'s `~/.codex/agents/` global-sync tier. The plugin
  tier's search path
  (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/agents/<role>.md`)
  was *observed*, not documented, in the session that wrote this code --
  `_find_claude_plugin_role_file()` glob-searches every
  marketplace/plugin/version combination under the search root rather than
  assuming a single fixed path, and **mechanically refuses (denies) rather
  than guesses** when more than one installed copy matches, asking for a
  project-tier override to disambiguate instead. This was confirmed to be a
  real, not theoretical, scenario in this session's own environment: eight
  distinct installed marketplace/plugin/version combinations of
  `code-reviewer.md` existed simultaneously in the actual plugin cache used
  to test this. Tested by `ClaudeCodeRunnerTests`.
- **Frontmatter parsing: mechanically enforced, targeted, not a general
  parser.** `_extract_markdown_frontmatter()` only extracts the fixed keys
  this tool needs (`model`, `effort`); any other declared field
  (`name`/`description`/`tools`/`generated`/`canonical_source`) is ignored,
  matching `_extract_toml_fields()`'s discipline for the Codex format.
  Verified directly against a real installed plugin's generated
  `agents/code-reviewer.md` in the same session, not only synthetic
  fixtures. Tested by `MarkdownFrontmatterTests`.
- **Sandbox narrowing: this runner can only ever produce `read-only` in this
  increment -- a scoping fact, not a gap someone forgot to close.** No field
  in the Claude Code wrapper format declares write-capability (unlike
  Codex's `.toml` `sandbox_mode` field); `ResolvedRole.sandbox_mode` is
  therefore always `None` for this runner, and
  `compute_effective_sandbox()`'s existing behavior (already tested for the
  Codex path) narrows a `None` file-declared sandbox to `read-only`
  regardless of `mode`. Extending this to write-capable Claude Code dispatch
  needs a new wrapper-format field and generator support -- tracked as
  follow-up, not done here. Tested by
  `ClaudeCodeRunnerTests.test_effective_sandbox_is_always_read_only_regardless_of_mode`.
- **`--permission-mode` mapping: an unreviewed design choice, not a proven
  equivalent to Codex's `--sandbox`, and this is the single most important
  open risk in this section.** `build_claude_child_argv()` maps
  `read-only`/`workspace-write`/`danger-full-access` to Claude Code's
  `plan`/`acceptEdits`/`bypassPermissions` permission modes (flag and
  choices VERIFIED 2026-08-03 against a real installed `claude --help`).
  But Codex's `--sandbox` is (believed to be) an OS-enforced execution
  boundary, while Claude Code's `--permission-mode` governs whether Claude
  Code's own tool-dispatch layer auto-approves or blocks a tool call --
  a different enforcement mechanism with a different trust boundary (it
  trusts the Claude Code binary's own tool-gating logic to be correct,
  rather than relying on OS-level sandboxing independent of that binary).
  Because sandbox narrowing above means `workspace-write`/
  `danger-full-access` are currently unreachable in practice (this runner
  can only ever resolve to `read-only`), only the `plan` mapping is
  exercised in production today -- but this mapping must be re-examined by
  the accountable Security Lead specifically when write-capability is added
  for this runner, not assumed correct because it "looks" analogous to the
  Codex mapping.
- **Prompt delivery: verified empirically, reuses the existing pipeline
  unchanged.** A live `echo "..." | claude -p --model haiku` call in the
  session that wrote this code confirmed that omitting the positional
  `prompt` argument and piping stdin instead is read as the prompt exactly
  like Codex's trailing `-` convention -- so `compose_prompt()`'s existing
  untrusted-brief-fencing output (already covered by
  `ComposePromptTests`/the audit-redaction tests) is fed to a Claude Code
  child on stdin completely unchanged, via the same `spawn_and_wait()` both
  runners share. No `--system-prompt` flag is used, avoiding a decision
  about whether to duplicate `developer_instructions` between a flag and
  stdin.
- **Everything else (env allowlist, output caps, timeout/group-kill,
  confirmation gating, audit logging, depth guard) is runner-agnostic** --
  none of those controls inspect `runner` at all, so their existing
  enforcement/test coverage applies identically to a Claude Code dispatch.
- **Not verified: live, authenticated end-to-end execution of a real role
  dispatch.** The one live `claude` invocation in this session was a
  trivial smoke test of stdin-piping behavior with `--model haiku`, not a
  full role dispatch through `dispatch_secure_cloud_role()`/`dispatch_team()`
  against a real installed Claude Code CLI. Do this before relying on the
  Claude Code runner for anything beyond local development.

## GitLab evidence MCP server (`gitlab_core.py` / `gitlab_server.py`)

A separate, create-only MCP surface (`create_review_subtask`, `write_wiki_page`,
`write_evidence_comment`) for recording human-reviewable evidence in a single,
pre-configured, docs-only GitLab project. It shares `dispatch_core.py`'s
`ConfirmationGate`, `wrap_untrusted_output`, and audit-record mechanism
directly (not a reimplementation) but is otherwise an independent module with
its own token, transport, and retry logic. This section uses the same
mechanically-enforced/advisory classification as above.

- **Token handling: mechanically enforced.** `resolve_token()` reads exactly
  one env var (`GITLAB_SVC_TOKEN`; `GL_SVC_TOKEN`/`GITLAB_SERVICE_TOKEN` are
  never honored as aliases), lazily, only from inside a tool function that
  needs it -- never at import or server-startup time -- and fails closed on
  unset/empty/whitespace-only. The token travels only in the `PRIVATE-TOKEN`
  HTTP header, never a query parameter, never folded into an exception
  message, log line, or audit record. Tested by `TokenResolutionTests`,
  `TokenNeverLeaksTests`.
- **TLS / redirect controls: mechanically enforced.** `resolve_config()`
  requires `GITLAB_BASE_URL` to start with `https://`; there is no
  configuration path anywhere in this module that accepts an `http://` base
  URL or that can disable certificate verification (`_build_opener()` only
  ever constructs `ssl.create_default_context()` with no
  `check_hostname=False`/custom-verify-mode escape hatch). `_NoCrossHostRedirectHandler`
  refuses (raises `GitLabPermanentError`, never a silent fallthrough) any
  redirect whose target host differs from the original request's host, *and*
  any redirect whose target scheme is not `https` -- so a same-host
  `https`-to-`http` downgrade can never cause the `PRIVATE-TOKEN` header to be
  replayed in cleartext. `_build_opener()` also passes an explicit
  `urllib.request.ProxyHandler({})` to `build_opener()`, so proxying is
  disabled unconditionally regardless of any ambient `HTTPS_PROXY` /
  `https_proxy` / `ALL_PROXY` (or other `getproxies()`-recognized) environment
  variable in the process this module runs in -- without it,
  `build_opener()` silently installs its own default, environment-driven
  `ProxyHandler()` (it only omits a default handler class when an instance of
  that exact class is already among the handlers passed in, and none of this
  module's other handlers is a `ProxyHandler`), which would route every
  GitLab API call through an attacker- or misconfiguration-controlled proxy
  with no logging and no opt-out anywhere in this module. This is the same
  "no escape hatch anywhere" discipline as the TLS-verification and redirect
  controls above, extended to ambient-environment-driven proxy routing, not
  just GitLab-response-driven redirects. Tested by
  `ConfigResolutionTests.test_requires_https_base_url` and `RedirectAndTlsTests`
  (cross-host redirect, same-host scheme-downgrade redirect, a code-reading
  assertion that no env var or config value can weaken the SSL context's
  `check_hostname`/`verify_mode`, and an assertion that the opener's
  `ProxyHandler` carries an explicit empty proxy map even when
  `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy`/`ALL_PROXY` are set in the ambient environment).
- **Create-only invariant / no state-transition path: mechanically enforced
  at two distinct layers -- Python call-graph shape, and GitLab body-text
  interpretation. Be precise about what each layer actually covers; neither
  alone is the whole guarantee.**
  - *Python-level structural guarantee.* This module implements no function,
    and calls no function anywhere in its own source or `dispatch_core.py`'s,
    that closes, reopens, resolves, or relabels-away-from-open-review a
    GitLab issue. `create_review_subtask` only ever performs a `GET`
    (idempotency search) and at most one `POST`. Tested by
    `StructuralNoStateTransitionTests` (name-shape scan of every function in
    the module, an explicit check that the named forbidden functions don't
    exist, a source-level check that GitLab's `state_event` field is never
    used, and a scan of `create_review_subtask`'s own function body for a
    call-shaped use of a forbidden verb). **This layer, by itself, cannot see
    a GitLab-side effect triggered by body text this module sends** -- it
    only scans this module's own Python source and call shapes, and GitLab
    itself interprets a note/issue body server-side as coming from this
    module's own service-account token, entirely independent of which HTTP
    endpoint sent that body. A prior round of this document described the
    create-only invariant as "mechanically enforced" based on this layer
    alone; that was accurate about the Python call graph but incomplete about
    the actual guarantee a caller experiences, which is why the second layer
    below was added.
  - *Body-text quick-action neutralization.* GitLab executes "quick actions"
    (slash-commands such as `/close`, `/unlabel`, `/relabel`,
    `/confidential`, `/lock`, `/reopen`, `/label`) embedded anywhere in an
    issue description or a note body, interpreted server-side as coming from
    the note's author -- this integration's own service-account token --
    regardless of which of this module's own HTTP endpoints sent that body.
    Before this fix, a caller-supplied `description` (`create_review_subtask`)
    or `content` (`write_evidence_comment`) line like `/close` or
    `/unlabel ~"review-subtask"` reached GitLab byte-identical and was
    executed, silently transitioning the evidence issue's state even though
    no Python code path in this module ever called a close/label-removal
    endpoint -- defeating the create-only guarantee at the effect level, not
    the call-graph level, and invisible to `StructuralNoStateTransitionTests`
    since the transition happens via GitLab's own body-text interpretation.
    `_reject_quick_action_syntax()` now rejects (never silently strips or
    truncates) any line whose first non-whitespace characters match
    `^\s*/[a-z][a-z_]*\b`, matched case-insensitively (`re.IGNORECASE`) since
    GitLab's own quick-action matching is case-insensitive server-side
    (verified against `lib/gitlab/quick_actions/extractor.rb`) -- a prior
    version of this filter was case-sensitive and so missed `/Close`,
    `/CLOSE`, `/UNLABEL ~"review-subtask"`, and any other case-varied
    command, all of which GitLab still executes; that gap is now closed. The
    pattern is applied to caller-supplied `description`/`content`, raising
    `GitLabValidationError` before any HTTP call, applied *before*
    `create_review_subtask`'s own trusted `/relate #<iid>` line is appended
    (so the check only ever sees caller-supplied text, and that
    module-authored line -- a deliberate, intentional quick action this
    module relies on for the hierarchy fallback -- is never itself rejected).
    This filter is deliberately broader than GitLab's real, finite quick-action
    command list -- GitLab's own extractor only interprets a line as a quick
    action if it names one of a fixed set of registered command names
    (matched via `Regexp.union(names)`; a line like `/notacommand` is never
    interpreted), but this module matches any line merely *shaped* like a
    quick action, so it never needs to track GitLab's exact, version-specific
    command set to remain safe. The tradeoff is over-rejection of some
    legitimate content shaped like a quick action (e.g. a fenced code block
    containing a shell command starting with `/`, or a path-starting log
    line) that GitLab's real extractor would not have interpreted because it
    excludes inline code, fenced code blocks, and quote blocks from
    quick-action parsing and this module's filter does not; that is a known,
    accepted false-positive/usability gap, not a security gap, and is
    tracked as separate follow-up work rather than fixed here.
    `write_wiki_page`'s `content` is deliberately NOT run through this check:
    GitLab's quick-action interpreter only ever parses issue/note bodies, not
    wiki page content (see `write_wiki_page`'s own docstring for the
    "Quick-action scope note" and the revisit condition if that is ever found
    to be inaccurate for a specific GitLab version/edition). Tested by
    `QuickActionNeutralizationTests`.
- **Idempotency search: mechanically enforced, exact-match, never a substring
  match against untrusted content.** `_find_existing_subtask()` queries with
  `state=opened` (a closed/already-resolved issue is never silently adopted;
  a fresh call after the prior subtask was closed intentionally creates a new
  one) and all three labels -- `review-subtask`, `gate:<gate_id>`, and a
  hash-based `evidence-key:<hash>` label derived from
  `(task_id, gate_id, parent_issue_iid)` -- filtered server-side and
  re-verified locally against each candidate's own `labels`/`state` fields,
  paginated (`per_page=100`, bounded page loop) so a match beyond an
  unpaginated first page is never missed. Folding `parent_issue_iid` into the
  hashed input (not only `task_id`/`gate_id`) is what restores parent binding
  deterministically and structurally: without it, an open issue carrying the
  right three labels would be adopted as a match regardless of which parent
  it actually references, which was a real regression introduced when the
  matching moved off the untrusted free-text `Parent: #<iid>` description
  check. The `Parent: #<iid>` text is still written into the description for
  human readability only and is never read back for matching. The prior
  design's unauthenticated substring match against issue description text is
  gone entirely; a decoy issue would need the exact three-label combination,
  which requires the same permission tier (e.g. GitLab Reporter+ on this
  project) the legitimate create flow already assumes -- not the same
  identity/credential, since any project member at that tier can label an
  issue. `create_review_subtask`'s result surfaces `state` at the top level
  (not only nested inside the wrapped issue payload) for both a reused match
  and a freshly created issue. Tested by `CreateReviewSubtaskTests`.
  **Honest limit, distinct from the stale/poisoning issues already fixed in
  earlier rounds: the search-then-create sequence is not atomic under
  genuine concurrency.** Two independent concurrent calls with the same
  `(task_id, gate_id, parent_issue_iid)` can both observe "no existing
  issue" via their own GET before either has POSTed, and both then POST,
  producing two open issues carrying the identical evidence-key label. There
  is no distributed lock or server-side compare-and-swap primitive closing
  this gap, and none is added in this round -- disclosed explicitly (see
  `create_review_subtask`'s own docstring) rather than implicitly claimed
  away by the word "idempotent".
- **Retry / fail-closed behavior: mechanically enforced.** `request_json()`
  retries 429/5xx/timeout/network errors with bounded jittered exponential
  backoff (`MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `MAX_RETRY_ELAPSED_SECONDS`) and raises
  immediately, without retry, on 401/403/404. Every non-2xx/network outcome
  raises a `GitLabError` subclass rather than fabricating a success shape; no
  caller-visible false success is possible. **Honest limit:** retrying a
  non-idempotent write (POST/PUT) on a 5xx/timeout cannot distinguish
  "never processed" from "processed but the response was lost" without a
  server-side idempotency key the targeted GitLab REST API doesn't expose --
  `create_review_subtask`'s search-before-create is this module's mitigation
  for the one operation where a duplicate would be most visible;
  `write_evidence_comment` and `write_wiki_page` have no equivalent
  caller-level dedup and could in principle double-apply on this specific
  failure shape. Tested by `RequestJsonRetryTests`.
- **1 MiB evidence-comment cap: mechanically enforced.** `write_evidence_comment`
  rejects (never truncates) content whose UTF-8 encoding exceeds
  `MAX_EVIDENCE_COMMENT_BYTES` (1 MiB), before any HTTP call.
  `write_wiki_page` has its own, separate 2 MiB cap
  (`MAX_WIKI_PAGE_CONTENT_BYTES`), also reject-not-truncate, before any HTTP
  call. Tested by `WriteEvidenceCommentTests`.
- **Untrusted-output wrapping: mechanically enforced, including the error
  path.** Every piece of GitLab-retrieved content returned in a *successful*
  tool result (`result["issue"]`, `result["page"]`, `result["comment"]`) is
  wrapped with `dispatch_core.wrap_untrusted_output`'s exact marker-token
  scheme via `wrap_untrusted_gitlab_payload()`, so text an attacker
  deliberately wrote into an issue title/description/wiki body/comment can
  never be mistaken by the calling model for a trusted instruction. The
  *error* path gets the same treatment: `_error_result()` wraps
  `GitLabPermanentError`/`GitLabRetryableExhaustedError`'s `str(error)` --
  which can embed a snippet of GitLab's own raw response body -- with the
  identical marker-token scheme before it reaches `result["reason"]`; a
  validation/config error's message is this module's own generated wording
  and is returned unwrapped. Tested by `UntrustedWrappingTests` (success
  path, asserting the marker tokens themselves are present in the payload,
  not merely that some substring of the underlying data appears) and
  `TokenNeverLeaksTests`/the retry test suite (error path).
- **Error-response bodies never reach the audit trail: mechanically
  enforced.** `request_json()` still embeds a snippet of GitLab's raw
  response body in the exception `message` used for the caller-facing
  result above, but every audit-record write uses
  `_audit_safe_reason(error)` instead of `str(error)` -- which returns
  `GitLabPermanentError.audit_reason` (a body-free, this-module-generated
  variant) rather than the raw-body-bearing message -- plus, when available,
  a `response_body_sha256`/`response_body_length` pair (hash/length only,
  never content) via `_audit_error_meta()`. `dispatch_core._FORBIDDEN_AUDIT_KEYS`
  additionally now includes `content`/`body`/`description` as a defense-in-
  depth backstop against any future call site accidentally passing raw
  content under one of those names.
- **Human-confirmation gate for `write_wiki_page`: same mechanism and same
  honest limit as `dispatch_core.py`'s own `ConfirmationGate` above.** Every
  call, with no exception, must round-trip through a first
  `confirmation_required` response and a second call replaying the token
  bound to the exact `(slug, title, format, content hash)` tuple before any
  GitLab write happens. This is mechanically enforced for the two-call,
  single-use, TTL-bound, tamper-detecting mechanism itself; it is **not** and
  cannot be enforced from inside this tool that a human actually read the
  intermediate response before a fully autonomous caller issued the second
  call. The first call's `confirmation_required` response also discloses
  `will_overwrite_existing: bool`, computed by checking `_get_wiki_page()`
  *before* requesting confirmation (not folded into the tamper-detected
  `brief` itself, so a page's existence changing between the two calls can
  never spuriously invalidate an otherwise-unchanged confirmation) -- so the
  human approving the confirmation sees whether the write creates a new page
  or overwrites an existing one as part of what they're approving, not only
  after the fact. Tested by `WriteWikiPageConfirmationTests`,
  `WriteWikiPageCreateVsUpdateTests`, `GetWikiPageTests`.
  **Honest limit: the disclosed `will_overwrite_existing` hint can go stale
  during the confirmation window.** It is computed once, before requesting
  confirmation, from whichever page state existed at that moment; because
  the confirmation TTL is up to `CONFIRMATION_TTL_SECONDS` (300s), another
  actor could create or delete a page at the same slug before the second
  call. The actual write always re-checks fresh at consume-time (`_get_wiki_page()`
  inside the confirmed branch), so the create-vs-update *behavior* is never
  wrong -- only the informational hint shown to the approving human can lag
  reality. No code fix for this in this round; see `write_wiki_page`'s own
  docstring for the same note.
- **Audit trail: mechanically enforced.** Every call to all three tools
  writes a structured JSON-lines audit record via
  `dispatch_core.build_audit_record`/`write_audit_record` (the same
  forbidden-key redaction as the main dispatch audit log applies here too),
  to its own file (`~/.agents/mcp-gitlab/audit.jsonl`, distinct from
  `dispatch_core`'s `~/.agents/mcp-dispatch/audit.jsonl`) -- covering every
  confirmation-requested / confirmed / denied / unavailable / ok outcome, not
  only final success. Records carry the tool name, task_id (when the tool's
  signature has one), gate_id/parent_issue_iid/issue_iid/slug identifiers, a
  content hash/length in place of raw wiki/comment body content, the returned
  GitLab artifact identifier (issue iid / comment id) on success, and the
  decision -- never the token, never a raw confirmation-token value, never
  wiki/comment/issue body content. Tested by `AuditTrailTests`.
- **Deliberate, stated scope boundary: `classification` is intentionally not
  an in-code parameter on any of this module's three tools.** Unlike
  `dispatch_core.py`'s `dispatch_secure_cloud_role`/`dispatch_team`, this
  module performs no classification check at all. This is a recorded,
  human-accepted residual-risk decision, not an oversight: containment is
  achieved operationally, by pointing `GITLAB_BASE_URL`/`GITLAB_DOCS_PROJECT_ID`
  at a dedicated, docs-only GitLab project and issuing a least-privilege
  service token scoped to only that project, rather than by an in-code
  classification gate. See `gitlab_core.py`'s module docstring for the same
  statement. If this integration is ever pointed at a project that also holds
  higher-classification content, this boundary must be revisited before that
  happens, not assumed to still hold. Both `GITLAB_BASE_URL` and
  `GITLAB_DOCS_PROJECT_ID` are `global_only` in `roster/shared/src/settings.py`'s
  field registry (see `roster/RUNBOOK.md`'s config-file section) specifically
  so this operational containment can't be silently weakened by a
  project-local `.agents/cadre.yaml` -- untrusted, clonable repository
  content -- redirecting either value.
- **`agent-autonomy.yaml`'s `gitlab_issue_or_comment_write: on_request` is
  deliberately advisory-only, not mechanically enforced in code.** Unlike
  `gitlab_wiki_write: human_approval` (mechanically enforced above via
  `ConfirmationGate`), `create_review_subtask` and `write_evidence_comment`
  have no in-code confirmation gate of their own -- an agent operating under
  this policy calls them directly, on its own judgment of when a task
  warrants it, without a mandatory round trip. This is consistent with how
  every other `on_request`-ranked entry in `agent-autonomy.yaml` is already
  handled: `repository.commit`, `repository.push`, and
  `create_gitlab_merge_request` are also `on_request` and also have no
  matching in-code gate anywhere in this suite's tooling (they are ordinary
  git/GitLab operations an agent performs directly when a task calls for it,
  not operations wrapped in a confirmation mechanism). Treating
  `gitlab_issue_or_comment_write` the same way follows that existing
  precedent rather than introducing a new, inconsistent enforcement tier for
  one entry. If this is ever revisited to add real gating (mirroring
  `write_wiki_page`'s `ConfirmationGate` reuse), that is a deliberate policy
  change, not a gap being quietly closed.

## Not covered above

M-2 (hash-pinning the `mcp` dependency in `requirements-mcp.txt`) and M-3
(verifying the `codex exec` invocation shape in `build_child_argv()` against
a real `codex` binary) remain open, tracked via dated `TODO` comments at
their respective locations in the source. Neither could be meaningfully
resolved in this sandbox (no network/package access to fetch a verified
package hash or invoke a real Codex CLI binary), and both were categorized
by the security reviewer as shippable with a tracked follow-up rather than
must-fix-before-merge.
