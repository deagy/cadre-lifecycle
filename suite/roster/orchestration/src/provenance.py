"""Suite-input provenance binding for dispatch plans.

Implements PB-FR-1..3/6/7/9 from
`roster/orchestration/runs/cadre-idea-7-provenance-binding-2026-07-29/requirements.md`:
a sha256 content hash of the exact `catalog.yaml`/routing-configuration
bytes a dispatch plan was built from, plus a best-effort git commit
identity, assembled into the plan's `provenance` object.

This is deliberately a distinct, sibling concern to `dispatch_fingerprint`
(computed in `build_dispatch_plan.py`), not a replacement for it:

- `dispatch_fingerprint` is a self-consistency/determinism checksum over the
  plan's own emitted output -- "does this artifact match its own claimed
  content, and would the same inputs reproduce it."
- `provenance` binds the plan to the suite-input *content* that produced it
  -- "which exact `catalog.yaml`/routing configuration, and which git
  commit, generated this artifact" -- independently verifiable by an
  auditor who recomputes `sha256sum`/`git rev-parse HEAD` against a
  historical checkout, without needing to trust the generating process.

Nothing here reads `roster/runner-capabilities.json` (idea #8) or resolves
a project-local routing overlay (idea #6): per the requirements baseline's
PB-FR-5, the manifest is not bound at all (its build-time influence is
already transitively captured by hashing `catalog.yaml`); per PB-FR-4, the
overlay fields are reserved in the schema but stay absent until a separate,
currently unscoped integration change wires overlay resolution into the
dispatch-plan call path (see requirements.md Gap G-2). Never fabricate a
value for either -- omit the field entirely when there is no actual causal
read path behind it.

    Invoked with `catalog_path`'s parent directory as the git working

    boundary, so this needs no separate notion of "the repository root"
    (which, notably, is not necessarily `inputs.repository_root` in the
    emitted plan: that field is the *target* project `cadre select` was run
    against via `--root`, which may differ from the suite checkout that
    `catalog.yaml`/routing configuration actually live in).

    Returns an empty dict (no fields at all -- never a placeholder) when
    that directory is not inside a resolvable git working tree, the `git`
    binary is unavailable, or the lookup itself fails for any other reason
    (PB-FR-3, AC-5). `git_dirty_paths` is scoped to exactly the two files
    that were loaded to build the plan, not the whole working tree, so an
    unrelated dirty file elsewhere in the checkout doesn't make an
    unrelated plan look suspect. `status.relativePaths=true` is pinned
    explicitly (not left to ambient repo config) so the reported paths are
    deterministic across checkouts.
