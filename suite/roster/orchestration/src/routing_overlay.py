"""Resolve a project-local overlay of `roster/orchestration/routing.yaml`.

Implements idea #6 (`roster/orchestration/runs/cadre-idea-6-routing-overlay-
2026-07-29/requirements.md`, `REQ-CADRE-BACKLOG-6`) -- a project-local
customization surface for routing configuration, analogous to
`roster/shared/`'s `.agents/shared/<filename>` overlay (`roster/shared/src/
resolve.py`) but with per-`routing.yaml`-construct merge rules instead of a
single deep-merge/narrowing-only rule, because most of `routing.yaml`'s
sections carry gating/review-separation semantics `roster/shared/`'s
policy-preference files do not (RO-FR-3..RO-FR-15, requirements.md SS4/SS5).

Discovery (RO-FR-1, RO-NFR-1): a project expresses its overlay as a single
JSON file at `.agents/orchestration/routing-overlay.json`, found by walking
up from the current directory to the nearest `.git` boundary -- the exact
same algorithm `roster/shared/src/resolve.py::find_project_overlay` and
`roster/knowledge-store/src/config.py` already use, reused here via
`resolve.find_file_at_project_root` rather than reimplemented (this
mechanism is JSON-only, unlike `.agents/shared/`'s YAML-or-JSON files, so it
does not need a PyYAML dependency -- `routing.yaml` itself is JSON despite
its `.yaml` filename; see RO-NFR-3).

Per-section merge rules (RO-FR-3..RO-FR-15, `requirements.md` SS4/SS5):

- `routes[]` / `risk_rules[]`: an overlay may add a new `id`-keyed entry
  (must not collide with any `id` already present across `routes` +
  `risk_rules` + `team_recipes` combined -- RO-FR-3), and may widen an
  *existing* base entry's `keywords` / `keyword_groups` / `paths` by
  supplying a value for that field that is a superset of the base value
  (RO-FR-4); any other field present on a widen-patch entry must equal the
  base value exactly, or resolution fails closed (RO-FR-5). This applies
  uniformly to every base entry, not only ones that currently declare a
  `human_gate` (RO-FR-13) -- narrowing a base entry's matching conditions
  is treated as equivalent to weakening its `human_gate`/`reviewers`, even
  though those fields are never directly touched.
- `team_recipes[]`: purely additive. A new, non-colliding `id` may be added;
  an existing base `id` is fully immutable (no widen exception -- RO-FR-7).
- `change_intake`: `keywords` / `agents` / `quality_gates` are additive-only
  (RO-FR-8).
- `cross_stack`: `route_ids` / `support` are additive-only; `minimum_matches`
  may only decrease from the base value, never increase (RO-FR-9).
- `knowledge_focus`: ordinary structured-file deep-merge, overlay wins per
  key -- no narrowing restriction, since it carries no gating/dispatch/
  review-separation semantics (RO-FR-10).
- `ignored_gates`: may only shrink (remove an already-present entry), never
  grow (RO-FR-11, Gap G-1).
- `version`: fixed; an overlay may repeat the base value as a no-op but may
  not change it (RO-FR-12).

Fails closed (raises `RoutingOverlayError`, or exits non-zero from the CLI)
on: a malformed/unparsable overlay file, an unrecognized top-level or
per-section field, an `id` collision between an overlay-added entry and any
base `routes`/`risk_rules`/`team_recipes` entry, any attempt to add to
`ignored_gates` or change `version`, any attempt to change a base
`routes[]`/`risk_rules[]` entry's `primary`/`reviewers`/`support`/
`quality_gates`/`human_gate` field, and any attempt to narrow a base
entry's `keywords`/`keyword_groups`/`paths` (RO-NFR-2).

When no project-local overlay is found, the effective configuration is the
base file's own bytes, unchanged (RO-FR-2, AC-1) -- this module never
reformats `routing.yaml` when there is nothing to merge.

The materialized effective configuration is a plain JSON file in
`routing.yaml`'s own shape, so `routing_health.py --routing <path>` and
`schema_validate.py --routing <path>` (idea #10) can consume it with their
existing, unmodified `--routing` CLI argument -- zero code changes to either
checker (OD-4, RO-FR-16, RO-FR-17).

Run:

    python3 roster/orchestration/src/routing_overlay.py --out /tmp/effective-routing.json
    python3 roster/orchestration/src/routing_overlay.py --check

`--check` validates discovery + merge without requiring `--out`, in the same
spirit as `generate_role_metadata.py --check` / `generate_authority_aides.py
--check` (RO-NFR-6): non-zero exit and a stderr finding on any overlay
problem, zero exit (and a one-line confirmation) otherwise.
