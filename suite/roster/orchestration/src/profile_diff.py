"""Report drift between a consuming project's copy of this suite's provider
profile (`provider.json` / `profiles/<id>/profile.json`) and this suite's
own current release of those same two artifacts.

This is a **read-only, information-only** report. It never writes to, nor
attempts to re-sync or remediate, anything belonging to a consuming
project, and it never reads or interprets that project's `.agentic-sdlc/`
gate-approval, human-authority, or risk-acceptance state -- only the
project-supplied provider/profile copy itself and (optionally) a
caller-supplied snapshot of the provider/profile content that copy was
originally captured from ("ORIGINAL"). See
`roster/orchestration/runs/cadre-idea-4-profile-diff-2026-07-29/
requirements.md` (PD-FR-13..PD-FR-17) for the boundary rules this module
implements, and `CLAUDE.md`'s "Two-repo boundary" section for why: this
suite supplies release artifacts and comparison logic only, never authority
over another project's lifecycle records.

Three inputs feed the comparison, per artifact (`provider.json` and
`profile.json` are compared independently):

- CURRENT -- this suite's own current release content. Defaults to the
  nearest `provider.json` found by walking up from this file's own
  location (matches both a source checkout's `provider/provider.json`
  and a packaged plugin install's top-level `provider.json` without
  needing separate packaging-specific wiring), or may be overridden
  explicitly.
- COPY -- the consuming project's currently-present copy. Always supplied
  explicitly by the caller (`--copy-provider` / `--copy-profile`); this
  module never guesses at, or interprets the shape of, a project's
  `.agentic-sdlc/` layout to find it (PD-FR-17).
- ORIGINAL -- the provider/profile content COPY was captured from,
  identified by whatever version-lock reference the caller's own project
  keeps (format and location are that project's / the separate
  `deagy/agentic-sdlc` kernel's concern, not this module's -- see
  `requirements.md` OD-2/G-2). Supplied explicitly and optionally
  (`--original-provider` / `--original-profile`); if omitted, or the
  supplied file cannot be read/parsed, the artifact is reported as
  `provenance-undetermined` rather than silently defaulting ORIGINAL to
  CURRENT or COPY (PD-FR-3).

Classification (first match wins, per requirements.md PD-FR-5):

    1. copy-invalid            -- COPY fails basic structural validation
    2. provenance-undetermined -- ORIGINAL could not be resolved
    3. current                 -- COPY == CURRENT
    4. stale-unmodified        -- COPY == ORIGINAL, ORIGINAL != CURRENT
    5. diverged                -- COPY != ORIGINAL (regardless of ORIGINAL
                                   vs. CURRENT)

Run:

    cadre profile diff --copy-provider path/to/provider.json \\
                        --copy-profile path/to/profile.json \\
                        [--original-provider PATH] [--original-profile PATH] \\
                        [--profile-id secure-cloud] [--json]

Exit code 0 means every compared artifact is `current`; any other resolved
state (including `copy-invalid` and `provenance-undetermined`) exits 1.
Per PD-FR-16, a `current` result and its exit code are drift information
only -- never treat either as an approval, gate-pass, or compliance signal.
