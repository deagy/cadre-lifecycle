# Unclassified Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Match["Matched Routes/Risks (no recognized workflow shape)"] --> Dispatch["Dispatch Selected Roles"]
    Dispatch --> Gates["Follow required_quality_gates from the Plan"]
```

This workflow has no fixed phase/gate/authority shape by design — the
deciding authority is whatever `required_quality_gates`/`human_gates` the
matched routes and risk rules actually produced in the plan.

Emitted when the selector matched at least one route or risk rule (so real roster/reviewers were selected — this is not `needs-triage`) but the matched combination does not fit any of this repository's recognized workflow shapes (new service, product intake, infrastructure/pipeline change, debugging, runtime assurance, production release, rollback, support escalation, knowledge ingestion).

1. Do not assume `unclassified` means low-risk or low-priority — it is a statement about workflow-shape recognition, not about the task's actual impact. Read `matched_routes`, `matched_risks`, and the selected `agents` groups to understand what was actually matched.
2. Proceed with the selected `primary`/`reviewers`/`support` roles and `required_quality_gates` exactly as any other plan — `unclassified` changes nothing about dispatch authority, human gates, or approval separation.
3. If the same route/risk combination recurs often enough to warrant its own recognized shape, propose a new workflow (a `roster/workflows/<id>.md` file plus a `_select_workflow()` branch and schema enum entry in `roster/orchestration/src/build_dispatch_plan.py`/`roster/orchestration/selection.schema.json`) rather than leaving it perpetually unclassified.

This workflow exists specifically so an unrecognized route/risk combination is never silently mislabeled as `new-service` (or any other specific shape) by a catch-all fallback — see `roster/orchestration/src/build_dispatch_plan.py`'s `_select_workflow()`.
