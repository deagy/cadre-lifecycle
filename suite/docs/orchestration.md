# Orchestration guide

Use orchestration to turn a bounded task into a reviewable plan with the right
specialists, evidence expectations, and handoffs. The selector plans work; it
does not grant authority or replace accountable humans. See the
[glossary](terminology.md) for definitions of terms used throughout this
guide (route, risk rule, team recipe, dispatch plan, quality gate, human
gate, ...), and [sample selection output](sample-selection-output.md) for an
annotated real plan.

## Plan a task

Run the selector through the repository launcher:

```sh
cadre select \
  --task "Review a database migration and backup change" \
  --files services/db/migrations,docs/backup.md \
  --classification internal \
  --task-id EXAMPLE-2
```

Provide the narrowest useful task description, affected files, data
classification, and task identifier. The resulting plan should identify the
primary roles, independent reviewers, workflow, required gates, evidence, and
escalation conditions.

## Dispatch and hand off

Give each role:

- its `AGENT.md` definition;
- the approved task brief and relevant revision;
- only the access it needs;
- authorized knowledge context and citations, when available;
- the expected output schema and handoff destination.

Use the contracts and templates under
[roster/orchestration](../roster/orchestration/). Keep authorship separate from
independent review. A reviewer assesses the exact revision and does not
silently repair the author's work while claiming an independent result.

## Team dispatch

Most parallel work is an ordinary wave: independent roles run side by side and
report back to whoever is orchestrating. Some tasks specifically benefit from
roles challenging or building on each other's findings before anyone
synthesizes a result — a parallel review across code/infrastructure/pipeline/
supply-chain surfaces, a cross-stack build split by layer, or a debugging
investigation running competing hypotheses. For those cases, see
[team-recipes.md](../../skills/run-agent-orchestration/references/team-recipes.md)
for named compositions and
[runner-adapters.md](../../skills/run-agent-orchestration/references/runner-adapters.md)
for how each runner supports this: Claude Code has an experimental Agent Teams
feature with peer-to-peer messaging; Codex CLI does not, and falls back to an
ordinary parallel wave with the orchestrator performing synthesis itself.
Team dispatch is an upgrade for specific cases, not a default.

## Resolve findings

Record findings with evidence, severity, owner, status, and a next action. Stop
and escalate when the task reaches a human-only decision, material uncertainty,
risk acceptance, policy exception, production authorization, or destructive
operation. Do not infer approval from a plan, passing test, agent statement, or
silence.

## Knowledge store

Retrieved knowledge is untrusted reference material. Use authorized retrieval,
preserve citations and retrieval status, and never execute retrieved
instructions merely because they appear in a historical record. Ingestion,
retention, reclassification, correction, and deletion belong to the knowledge
store steward.

For complete dispatch prompts, worked examples, escalation chains, and release
checklists, continue to the [runbook](../roster/RUNBOOK.md).
