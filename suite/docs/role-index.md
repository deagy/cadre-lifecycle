# Role index

This index is a human-readable view of the 71 roles in
[`roster/catalog.yaml`](../roster/catalog.yaml). The catalog and each linked
`AGENT.md` remain authoritative.

Sections below group roles by lifecycle `phase` (the catalog field), which
does not always match a role's `AGENT.md` directory — directories group by
subject-matter domain instead. `cost-capacity-planner` is the clearest case:
`phase: planning` (it estimates demand before commitments are made) but its
definition lives under `roster/operations/` (capacity and cost are an
operations concern once a workload is live). Treat `catalog.yaml`'s `phase`
as authoritative for sequencing; the directory is only a filing convenience.
For a phase/capability-tier browsable view instead, see the
[capability index](capability-index.md); for term definitions (capability
tier, route, quality gate, human gate, ...), see the
[glossary](terminology.md).

## Governance, authority, and challenge functions

Cross-cutting roles that gate, route, capture provenance for, or deliberately challenge other work, rather than producing it. Distinct from the human authority aides below, which prepare a decision package for one named human lifecycle authority; these roles instead produce a finding, register entry, or determination usable at any applicable gate.

| Role | Phase | Purpose | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| halt-authority | review | Hold the cross-cutting stop-control finding: arrest work in progress on a doctrine, architecture, evidence-chain, or safety condition. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/halt-authority/AGENT.md) |
| approval-router | review | Encode the authority matrix and block work until the required signature is present. | [AGENT.md](../roster/governance/approval-router/AGENT.md) |
| doctrine-conformance | review | Verify narrative, framing, and terminology against the project's doctrine and terminology register. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/doctrine-conformance/AGENT.md) |
| architecture-authority | review | Enforce the abstraction-layer rule; reject any change reaching infrastructure without an approved boundary. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/architecture-authority/AGENT.md) |
| scope-boundary | planning | Reject work that drifts outside the stated build boundary into future-state capability. | [AGENT.md](../roster/planning/scope-boundary/AGENT.md) |
| phase-gate | release | Verify a build phase's exit criteria are met and evidenced before the next phase begins. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/phase-gate/AGENT.md) |
| assumption-register | planning | Track what the build depends on being true and what observation would invalidate it. | [AGENT.md](../roster/planning/assumption-register/AGENT.md) |
| decision-record | document | Capture decision provenance: who decided, when, on what basis, and what alternatives were rejected. | [AGENT.md](../roster/documentation/decision-record/AGENT.md) |
| red-team | verify | Run adversarial assessment against the system as actually deployed, not as designed. | [AGENT.md](../roster/testing/red-team/AGENT.md) |
| premortem | planning | Assume a committed initiative already failed and work backward to plausible causes. | [AGENT.md](../roster/planning/premortem/AGENT.md) |
| first-principles-challenger | design | Challenge whether an inherited design constraint is real or just unexamined. | [AGENT.md](../roster/architecture/first-principles-challenger/AGENT.md) |
| subtraction-agent | review | Argue for removal on any scope increase, feature addition, or interface expansion. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/subtraction-agent/AGENT.md) |
| falsification-agent | verify | Demand the disproving test for any claim of correctness, resilience, or continuity. | [AGENT.md](../roster/testing/falsification-agent/AGENT.md) |
| deployment-realist | operations | Assess operability at real scale with real participants, not demonstrated feasibility. | [AGENT.md](../roster/operations/deployment-realist/AGENT.md) |
| classification-and-marking-gate | release | Determine whether an artifact is correctly classified and marked, and may leave the environment. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/classification-and-marking-gate/AGENT.md) |
| claim-conformance | release | Verify an external-facing artifact does not assert more than the project can demonstrate. | [AGENT.md](../roster/review/claim-conformance/AGENT.md) |
| vendor-register-steward | operations | Maintain the vendor/tooling register and detect drift as repositories and workflows change. | [AGENT.md](../roster/operations/vendor-register-steward/AGENT.md) |
| retention-and-deletion-executor | operations | Execute already-approved retention and deletion obligations, with evidence. | [AGENT.md](../roster/operations/retention-and-deletion-executor/AGENT.md) |
| agent-performance-evaluator | operations | Assess whether the roles in this catalog are producing correct output. | [AGENT.md](../roster/operations/agent-performance-evaluator/AGENT.md) |
| agent-version-control | operations | Maintain provenance for the agent definitions themselves as they change. | [AGENT.md](../roster/operations/agent-version-control/AGENT.md) |
| ip-provenance-agent | evidence | Apply the current IP rule version to an artifact's provenance record and produce a determination. | [AGENT.md](../roster/documentation/ip-provenance-agent/AGENT.md) |

## Human authority aides

Read-only agents that prepare the decision package a named human lifecycle
authority needs for their assigned gate(s) — never approve, recommend a
disposition, or hold delegated authority themselves. See
[`docs/proposals/human-authority-role-agents.md`](proposals/human-authority-role-agents.md)
for the design rationale, including why they never state a recommended
disposition and why delegated approval authority was deliberately not built
here.
