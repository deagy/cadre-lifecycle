## Source of truth

Canonical role definitions, policies, routing, workflows, and orchestration
contracts live under `roster/`. The packaged plugin ([`deagy/cadre-lifecycle`](https://github.com/deagy/cadre-lifecycle)) is
a self-contained distribution and may contain generated copies. Edit canonical
source files, then regenerate the package when the change requires it.

The portable lifecycle kernel is maintained separately in
[deagy/agentic-sdlc](https://github.com/deagy/agentic-sdlc). This repository
provides its Secure Cloud roles and provider profile; it does not own the
portable lifecycle state machine.
