# Capability index

This page lists all 71 roles from [`roster/catalog.yaml`](../roster/catalog.yaml)
grouped by their `capability` and `phase` fields, so you can find every role
in a given class of change authority (for example, every role that can only
review, or every role that can operate a live environment) or every role
active in a given lifecycle stage. `roster/catalog.yaml` remains the
authoritative source; this is a generated-by-hand snapshot of it, not a live
filter — regenerate it after any `catalog.yaml` change (see "Keeping this
page in sync" below).

For a purpose-oriented view grouped by subject-matter domain instead, see the
[role index](role-index.md). See the [glossary](terminology.md) for the
"capability tier" definition and other recurring terms.

## By capability

`capability` is each role's `roster/catalog.yaml` field. It describes the
class of change authority a role has, not its subject-matter domain --
see each role's own `AGENT.md` "Authority" section for its exact scope.

### `read_only` (28 roles)

Reads and evaluates only; produces findings, decision packages, or approvals but does not edit the artifact it assesses.

`phase` is each role's `roster/catalog.yaml` field, used for lifecycle
sequencing. It does not always match the role's `AGENT.md` directory --
see the [role index](role-index.md) for the subject-matter-domain
grouping instead.

## Keeping this page in sync

This page is a snapshot, not generated tooling output. After adding, removing,
or reclassifying a role in `roster/catalog.yaml` (its `capability` or `phase`
field, or the role set itself), update the corresponding table(s) above in
the same change. `python3 -m unittest agents.orchestration.test.test_repository_health`
checks catalog/plugin drift but does not check this page against the catalog;
treat divergence here as a documentation bug to fix by hand.
