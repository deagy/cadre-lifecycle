# Sample `cadre select` output

This walks through one real, committed `cadre select` plan so a reader can see
what the selector actually produces before running it themselves. The
authoritative shape is [`roster/orchestration/selection.schema.json`](../roster/orchestration/selection.schema.json)
(`schema_version: 3`); if this page and the schema ever disagree, the schema
wins.

See the [glossary](terminology.md) for definitions of the terms used below
(route, risk rule, team recipe, dispatch plan, quality gate, human gate,
knowledge focus, provenance, ...).

The example below is `GOLDEN-CROSS-STACK-1` from the golden-corpus regression
fixtures ([`roster/orchestration/test/fixtures/selection_golden_corpus.json`](https://github.com/deagy/cadre/blob/main/roster/orchestration/test/fixtures/selection_golden_corpus.json),
case id `CROSS-STACK-1`). It was chosen because it is a realistic, non-edge-case
task that touches two stacks at once (frontend and backend) and triggers a
named team recipe, which exercises most of the fields a reader will encounter
in practice. It is also asserted byte-for-byte against `build_dispatch_plan()`
in `test_selection_golden_corpus.py`, so this page cannot silently drift from
selector behavior without that test failing first.

## Reproduce it

```sh
cadre select \
  --task "Add a React upload form backed by a PostgreSQL API" \
  --files frontend/src/Upload.tsx,services/upload/main.go \
  --task-id GOLDEN-CROSS-STACK-1 \
  --classification internal
```

## The output

`repository_root`, `generated_at`, `source_filter`, and `dispatch_fingerprint`
are derived from the environment the selector runs in (working tree path,
wall-clock time, the `deagy/cadre` origin remote of this checkout, and a hash
over the rest of the plan, respectively) — expect different values in your own
checkout. `lifecycle_tracking.status` and `required_quality_gates[].reason`
also depend on your environment: this capture shows
`lifecycle_tracking.status: "integrated"` and gate-specific reasons because a
standalone Agentic SDLC executable was present on `PATH` when it ran; without
one, `lifecycle_tracking.status` reads `"standalone"` with a `reason`, and
every `required_quality_gates[].reason` instead reads "Required by routing
configuration (Agentic SDLC unavailable; gate detail omitted)." (see
`roster/orchestration/src/build_dispatch_plan.py`). `matched_routes`,
`agents`, `teams`, the *set* of gate ids in `required_quality_gates`, and
`human_gates` stay identical either way, and are pinned byte-for-byte by the
golden-corpus test referenced above (that test forces standalone mode so the
corpus is reproducible without the executable — see the fixture file's
comment).

## Reading the fields

- **`status` / `workflow`** — `status: "ready"` means the task matched at
  least one route; `"needs-triage"` means no route matched and the plan
  should not be treated as reviewable guidance. `workflow` is the single
  matched high-level shape (here `new-service`, since this task combines the
  `frontend` and `backend` routes).
- **`matched_routes`** — the `roster/orchestration/routing.yaml` route ids
  whose paths or keywords matched this task's files/description. Each route
  carries its own primary/reviewer/support role list; `agents.*` below is the
  union across every matched route.
- **`matched_risks`** — routing.yaml `risk_rules` (for example `production`
  or `destructive`) that matched. Empty here because this task is neither.
- **`agents.primary` / `.reviewers` / `.support`** — the deduplicated role ids
  selected across all matched routes: who implements, who independently
  reviews, and who supports without owning the change.
- **`dispatch_disposition`** — `"staffed"` when `agents.primary`/`.reviewers`
  hold an accountable executor or independent reviewer; `"advisory-only"` when
  only `agents.support` was populated with nothing else selected;
  `"no-agents-selected"` otherwise. An orchestrator must not treat
  `"advisory-only"` as authorization to do the work itself.
- **`teams`** — deterministic `team_recipes` (routing.yaml) triggered by the
  matched route combination; never adds a role that wasn't already in
  `agents.*`. This example's `cross-stack-build` recipe fires because both
  `frontend` and `backend` matched. `communication_mode: "peer"` /
  `fallback: "orchestrator-relayed"` describe what's actually possible per
  runner — see
  [runner-adapters.md](../../skills/run-agent-orchestration/references/runner-adapters.md).
- **`lifecycle_tracking`** — `"integrated"` when the standalone Agentic SDLC
  executable is on `PATH` and recognizes this repository's lifecycle
  contract; `"standalone"` (with a `reason`) otherwise. This does not mean
  gates were run — only whether the kernel is present to track them.
- **`required_quality_gates` / `ignored_quality_gates`** — the G1–G10 gates
  this task's matched routes and lifecycle phase require, each with the
  route(s) that contributed it, versus any gates explicitly ignored by
  `routing.yaml`'s `ignored_gates`.
- **`human_gates`** — gates requiring an accountable human decision (risk
  acceptance, production authorization, policy exception); empty here because
  this task reaches no such gate. Each entry also carries a
  `kernel_mutation_gate_id`, cross-referencing the Agentic SDLC kernel's own
  `contracts/mutation-gates.json` id where one exists — the kernel stays the
  authoritative definition, this is a pointer to it, not a duplicate.
- **`knowledge_context`** — one retrieval request per selected agent, each
  with the exact CLI invocation to run against the knowledge store
  (`--source` scoped to this repository's origin remote, `--classification`
  matched to the task). `status: "planned"` means retrieval is proposed, not
  performed — `cadre select` never executes retrieval itself.
- **`dispatch_fingerprint`** — a `sha256:`-prefixed hash over the rest of the
  plan, useful for detecting whether a plan changed between two runs.

The selector only produces this plan. It does not execute agents, retrieve
knowledge, approve gates, deploy, mutate infrastructure, merge, or push
changes — see the [orchestration guide](orchestration.md) for what happens
next with a plan like this.
