# Adopt-Cadre quickstart

A concrete, copy-pasteable walkthrough for a new project adopting this suite.
For background and full detail, see [Getting started](getting-started.md),
[Lifecycle and plugin operations](lifecycle-and-plugin-operations.md), and
[roster/RUNBOOK.md](../roster/RUNBOOK.md). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deagy/cadre/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
for what's changed in the suite recently.

## 1. Get `cadre` on `PATH`

Either clone this repository and symlink the launcher:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deagy/cadre.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s "$(pwd)/cadre/bin/cadre" ~/.local/bin/cadre   # ensure ~/.local/bin is on PATH
```

or, without keeping a checkout around, build and install the pip/pipx
distribution from a local build (not published to PyPI):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deagy/cadre.git && cd cadre
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build
pipx install dist/cadre-*.whl
```

Either way, `cadre` requires Python 3.10+. `cadre generate-plugin` and
`cadre generate-authority-aides` are maintainer-only — they need a full git
checkout of this repository and are not available from the pip/pipx install.
`cadre generate-role-metadata --check` works from either path, but its write
mode is checkout-only for the same reason. Every other subcommand works from
either install path.

Confirm it resolves (works from either install path):

```sh
cadre select --help
```

## 2. Initialize lifecycle tracking for your project

This suite's lifecycle gates (G1-G10) are owned by the separate, portable
[`deagy/agentic-sdlc`](https://github.com/deagy/agentic-sdlc) kernel. Install
it (see that repository's README for the current `pipx install` command and
release tag) and put its executable on `PATH`, or point `AGENTIC_SDLC_BIN` at
it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deagy/agentic-sdlc.git
git -C agentic-sdlc checkout <reviewed-tag>
export AGENTIC_SDLC_BIN=/path/to/agentic-sdlc/bin/agentic-sdlc
```

Then initialize your project through this suite's compatibility launcher,
using `--profile secure-cloud` if your project actually runs on this suite's
own target stack (Proxmox, Talos, Kubernetes, Helm, OpenTofu, GitLab CI,
PostgreSQL, React/TypeScript, Go). Use `quick`, `generic`, or `web-service`
instead for a different stack — `secure-cloud` pulls in 19 roles opinionated
toward that infrastructure and shouldn't be forced onto an unrelated one.

```sh
cadre sdlc init --root /path/to/your-project --profile secure-cloud \
  --project-id your-project --classification internal --runner claude
```

`--runner {codex,claude,both}` generates subagent wrapper files in your
project; omit it if your project doesn't want generated wrappers written.
This writes `.agentic-sdlc/` into your project — review the detected
technologies and commands, then assign human authorities (Product Owner,
Engineering Lead, System Architect, Governance Lead, Security Lead, Release
Owner, Release Authority, Service Owner) and decide environment
persistence/production status before expecting gates to pass. `init` never
infers approval, risk acceptance, or compliance applicability for you.

If you'd rather not touch a CLI, JSON, or YAML at all, ask an agent in your
project to run the `lifecycle-onboarding` skill instead — it drives this same
flow (and the optional shared-policy overlay in step 4) conversationally. See
[.agents/skills/lifecycle-onboarding/SKILL.md](../../plugins/lifecycle/skills/lifecycle-onboarding/SKILL.md).

Validate once you've made the required decisions:

```sh
cadre sdlc validate --root /path/to/your-project
```

## 3. Run a first `cadre select`

From inside your project (or with `--root /path/to/your-project`), generate a
deterministic dispatch plan for a real task — no agents run, nothing is
mutated, nothing is approved:

```sh
cadre select \
  --task "Add input validation to the upload endpoint" \
  --files backend/internal/api/upload.go \
  --classification internal \
  --task-id PROJ-101
```

This prints a plan (schema-versioned JSON) naming the primary/reviewer/support
roles, matched routes, required quality gates vs. mutation-oriented human
gates, and a `teams` array for any matching team recipe. It works standalone;
when `agentic-sdlc`/`AGENTIC_SDLC_BIN` is also resolvable it's automatically
enriched with lifecycle-gate tracking (`lifecycle_tracking.status:
"integrated"`) — pass `--require-sdlc` to fail instead of silently falling
back to standalone mode if that integration is required for your workflow.

If nothing matches your task, the selector returns `needs-triage` rather than
guessing — that's expected for a task that doesn't fit any routing rule yet
(see step 5 to add one).

## 4. Set up a project-local knowledge store (optional)

Without any setup, agents fall back to a store shared across every project on
the machine (`~/.agents/knowledge-store/`). If your project wants its content
kept isolated instead, create a project-local config at your project's
`.agents/knowledge-store/config.json` (found by walking up to the nearest
`.git` boundary, same as the shared-policy overlay below):

```sh
mkdir -p /path/to/your-project/.agents/knowledge-store
cp /path/to/cadre-checkout/roster/knowledge-store/config.example.json \
   /path/to/your-project/.agents/knowledge-store/config.json
```

Nothing else changes — every `cadre knowledge ...` command works identically
once the file exists; it just resolves to your project's own store instead of
the shared default. See
[roster/knowledge-store/README.md](../roster/knowledge-store/README.md) and
`roster/knowledge-store/SECURITY.md` before ingesting real content: retrieved
text is always untrusted reference data, never executable instruction.

## 5. Add a project-local routing overlay (optional)

If your project wants an extra route, a widened risk-rule keyword, or an
additional team recipe, you don't need to fork `orchestration/routing.yaml`.
Add a plain JSON file (not YAML) at your project's
`.agents/orchestration/routing-overlay.json` — discovered the same way as
`.agents/shared/` and `.agents/knowledge-store/config.json`, by walking up to
the nearest `.git` boundary. With no overlay present, behavior is unchanged.

The overlay's merge rule differs by section, because most of `routing.yaml`
carries gating semantics an ordinary policy overlay doesn't:

- `routes[]` / `risk_rules[]`: add a new non-colliding `id`, or *widen* an
  existing entry's `keywords`/`keyword_groups`/`paths` (every base value must
  still be present — narrowing fails closed). Every other field on that same
  entry (`primary`, `reviewers`, `support`, `quality_gates`, `human_gate`)
  must match the base value exactly.
- `team_recipes[]`: additive only — a new `id`; existing entries are
  immutable.
- `change_intake`: `keywords`/`agents`/`quality_gates` are additive only.
- `cross_stack`: `route_ids`/`support` are additive only; `minimum_matches`
  may only decrease.
- `knowledge_focus`: ordinary deep-merge, overlay wins per key.
- `ignored_gates`: may only shrink.
- `version`: fixed; may be repeated but not changed.

Validate and materialize the effective (merged) configuration:

```sh
python3 roster/orchestration/src/routing_overlay.py --check
python3 roster/orchestration/src/routing_overlay.py --out /tmp/effective-routing.json
```

The materialized file is plain `routing.yaml`-shaped JSON, so you can also
point `routing_health.py --routing <path>` or `schema_validate.py --routing
<path>` at it to validate the effective configuration your project actually
dispatches against, not just the unmodified base file.

## 6. Check for drift against this suite's canonical profile later

Once your project has its own copy of `provider.json` /
`profiles/<id>/profile.json` from `cadre sdlc init`, check later whether that
copy has drifted from this checkout's current release, without changing
anything:

```sh
cadre profile diff \
  --copy-provider  /path/to/your-project/.agentic-sdlc/provider.json \
  --copy-profile   /path/to/your-project/.agentic-sdlc/profile.json \
  --original-provider /path/to/captured-original-provider.json \
  --original-profile  /path/to/captured-original-profile.json
```

`--copy-provider`/`--copy-profile` (required) point at your project's current
copy — this suite doesn't assume a specific `.agentic-sdlc/` internal layout,
so use whatever path your project actually keeps them at.
`--original-provider`/`--original-profile` (optional) point at a snapshot of
what that copy was originally captured from, if you kept one; omitting them
is expected and reported as its own `provenance-undetermined` state rather
than guessed.

The report classifies each artifact independently as `current` (matches this
release exactly), `stale-unmodified` (matches ORIGINAL, which is now behind),
`diverged` (no longer matches ORIGINAL), `copy-invalid` (malformed JSON or a
missing required field), or `provenance-undetermined` (no ORIGINAL supplied),
naming every differing field in one pass. Exit code `0` means both artifacts
are `current`; anything else exits non-zero. **This is a drift report, not an
approval, gate-pass, or compliance signal** — it never re-syncs your project,
and it never reads or interprets your project's `.agentic-sdlc/`
gate-approval or human-authority state.
