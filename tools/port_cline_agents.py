"""Port `agents/*.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md` into `cline-agents/agents/`
and `cline-agents/skills/` -- the Cline SDK preset/skill formats.

This replaces what was previously a one-time hand port (see git history for
`cline-agents/agents/*.md` and `cline-agents/skills/*.md`). The agents port
was reverse-engineered from that hand port by diffing all 71 files against
their sources: it is a fixed lookup table of literal source-repo-relative
path references rewritten into consumer-neutral prose, applied identically
everywhere, plus a small number of named per-role exceptions where the
original port made a judgment call this script reproduces exactly. The
skills port previously never rewrote any of this at all -- every
`roster/`-relative reference and the (structurally dead, `cline-agents/`
ships no `suite/` directory) "Packaged suite note" callout were carried
over byte-identical. This script fixes that.

Both functions fail loudly (raise SystemExit) if a generated body still
contains a `roster/`-relative or `../`-relative reference the table doesn't
recognize and no exception covers -- a future new role or new shared-policy
file must either match the table or stop this script before regenerate.yml
opens a PR, rather than silently shipping a leaked source-repo path. Extend
PATH_SUBSTITUTIONS (or the per-role/per-skill exception maps) when that
happens; do not loosen the check.
