> Cline packaging note: this skill's instructions describe this repository's own `roster/`-layout tooling in the abstract (the role catalog, routing configuration, and selector this plugin bundles) -- they are not literal paths to look up in an arbitrary target project. When dispatching, use `start_subagent`/`dispatch_selected_roles`/`bin/cadre select` rather than reading these files directly.


# Agent Authoring

Use this skill when an agent change must be publishable and selectable, not just a loose Markdown file.

## Required changes

For each new or changed agent:

1. Add or update its own role-definition file with role, inputs, outputs, required checks, authority, escalation, and completion criteria.
2. Add its id to the bundled role catalog's ordering file (dispatch-precedence order), if not already present.
3. Metadata (`phase`, `capability`, `model`, `codex_model`, `reasoning_effort`, `knowledge_focus`) lives in the `---`-delimited frontmatter at the top of the role's `AGENT.md` (see "Frontmatter-based roles" below): update the frontmatter, then run `cadre generate-role-metadata` to regenerate this repository's bundled role catalog and routing.yaml's `knowledge_focus` block. Do not hand-edit those generated regions -- this repository's bundled role catalog and this repository's bundled routing configuration's `knowledge_focus` block are fully generated output, never an input. Note: this repository's bundled role catalog's regenerated key order always exactly tracks the bundled role catalog's ordering file, but `routing.yaml`'s `knowledge_focus` block does not -- it never reorders an already-present role and always appends a newly-added role's entry at the very end, so don't expect a new role's `knowledge_focus` entry to land near related roles there.
4. Update or add workflow/runbook examples when the role changes dispatch behavior.
5. Add selector tests in the bundled selector's own test suite for at least one representative path or keyword.
6. Regenerate the packaged plugin for the new or changed role in a checkout of [`deagy/cadre-lifecycle`](https://github.com/deagy/cadre-lifecycle) (`cadre generate-plugin --output /path/to/cadre-lifecycle`) and commit the result there. That repository's CI re-runs the same command with `--check` against the register revision pinned in its `cadre-ref.txt`, so the two only advance together, on a deliberate bump.
7. Run the orchestration test suite and confirm catalog definition paths exist.

### Frontmatter-based roles

Every role's `AGENT.md` starts with a `---`-delimited frontmatter block declaring `id`, `phase`, `capability`, `model`, `codex_model`, `reasoning_effort`, and `knowledge_focus` as flat scalar fields (see the bundled role-metadata module). `definition` is never stored in frontmatter -- it is always derived from the file's own path under `roster/`. A role's metadata comes entirely from its frontmatter; there is no fallback to a legacy `catalog.yaml`/`routing.yaml` entry, so a missing required field fails the generator closed rather than silently inheriting a stale value. An `AGENT.md` that does not carry frontmatter is a generator error, not a supported transitional state. Regenerate with `cadre generate-role-metadata` (the bundled role-metadata generator) after editing frontmatter, and validate with `cadre generate-role-metadata --check`.

## Guardrails

- Do not let an implementation agent approve its own work.
- Keep human-only decisions behind explicit gates.
- Keep role authority narrow and environment-specific.
- Prefer adding a focused specialist only when existing agents would blur accountability or miss recurring work.
